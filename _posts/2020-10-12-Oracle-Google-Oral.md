Oracle and Google's lawyers argued their [infamous, long-running API copyright lawsuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc.) at the Supreme Court last week.  If you haven't listened to a legal "oral argument" before, this might be an interesting way to start:

Warning: This is high-level legal conversation.  If you don't follow exactly what's going on, it's not you, it's the law.  Let it wash over you a bit, and enjoy the dynamics of the back-and-forth.
