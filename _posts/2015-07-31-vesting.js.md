[vesting][vesting] is an [npm][npm] package that calculates startup stock vesting. [vesting-commonform][vesting-commonform] is also an npm package that calculates startup stock vesting.

<!--jump-->

Each package exports a single JavaScript function. They take the same arguments.

[vesting][vesting] returns a function that calculates the number of vested shares, given the total shares subject to vesting, start date, and last day at work. [vesting-commonform][vesting-commonform] returns a [Common Form][commonform] vesting schedule using typical terminology and values for the fill-in-the-blanks it contains.

[vesting][vesting] and [vesting-commonform][vesting-commonform] are designed to produce equivalent results, given equivalent inputs. Another package, [vesting-implement][vesting-implement] takes the output of [vesting-commonform][vesting-commonform] and produces the output of [vesting][vesting]. It's verified with [round-trip automated tests][round-trips].

Code to legal. Legal to code.
