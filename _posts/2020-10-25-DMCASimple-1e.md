I've just finalized a first edition of DMCASimple, my go-to Digital Millennium Copyright Act or copyright policy for websites. The latest is on [dmcasimple.com](https://dmcasimple.com), which also has instructions for use.

Working on a logo for this one, too.

If I ever get around to standardizing my no-tracking, no-logs privacy policy, I'll have a nice little trio of forms.
