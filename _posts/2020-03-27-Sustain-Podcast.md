I appeared as guest on [episode 29 of the Sustain podcast](https://sustain.codefund.fm/29), talking about License Zero, open licenses, funding more generally, and practicing law.  Special thanks to my hosts---Richard, Eric, Pia, Justin, Gunnner---for having me on.

I've since improved my mic setup for recording and Internet calls.  I believe I had to dial into this one with my headset, but it doesn't sound too too bad.
