A lot of legal argument is argument by analogy.  In the most formal sense, that means talking about how a court decided an earlier, similar case, and whether the court should decide a new case in a similar way.  Lawyers also argue by hypothetical, making up stories using details of daily life that tend to show a case should go one way or another.

Here's a quick list of analogies mentioned by the justices of the Supreme Court and arguing lawyers during [oral argument](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/audio/2020/18-956) in the case of [Oracle v. Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc.):

- mathematical proofs, coarse and elegant
- writing in English and French
- words of a song the audience has learned by heart
- book of a thousand memorable _Seinfeld_ lines
- short story adapted to a movie
- QWERTY keyboard layout
- phone switchboard layout
- cooking spice shelving system
- organization of produce in a grocery store
- periodic table of the elements
- biological taxonomy
- connective tissue

I'm sure I've missed at least a couple.
