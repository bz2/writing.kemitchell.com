I highly recommend [Glyph](https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/)'s ["The Ethical Consequences of Our Collective Activities"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSbKjRRbjZs) from PyCon 2015.

I'm tempted to add some comments and dissemble on specific points.  I strongly disagree with others.  But this is clearly a talk by a very capable person who has engaged with the difficult notion of broader ethical accountability, done a lot of homework outside his own field, and applied a lot of attention to make it presentable back to his own kind.  That is a rare and a precious kind of thing.
