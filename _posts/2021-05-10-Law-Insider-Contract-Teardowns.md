Law Insider, a transactional law research service, has published a ["Contract Teardown" video series on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C6nLDXgt_Y&list=PLzLxxjKKSHN_LkIZUlTjoY5kPMw39Sv_B) where attorneys talk about specific provisions of published contracts.

The format is way better than my own attempt to do top-to-bottom reads on my own.  The interview prompts a guest, who calls out specific provisions of the contract under analysis.  The videos tend to run a little over twenty minutes long.
