title: The License is a Contract
---

One of the new things the [Blue Oak Model License](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0) did was treat the technical legal debate about "license versus contract" as a source of uncertainty to be avoided, rather than a hill to die on.  For a long time, especially free software activists and lawyers advocated for treating terms like the GPL only as legal "license"---one-way grants of permission---and not as legal "contracts"---enforceable agreements between two sides---because they feared the additional power contract law provides.  But reading through Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) license again today, I realized again how far behind the strange cult of open software licensing remains.

This language is right at the top:

> By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License").  To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

How could anyone without legal training hope to make sense of this?  It must read like nonsense.  Let's take it apart.

> By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License").

Key Words: "accept", "agree to be bound". In lawyerspeak, this is contract vocabulary.  Parties "accept" offers of contract terms.  They "agree to be bound" by contract terms.

> To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract,...

Note Here: To this extent, and not beyond it.  In other words, you can read this as an "if".  _If_ the license is treated as a contract, _then_....

> ...You are granted the Licensed Rights

_If_ this is a contract, _then_ you get a license.

That is the orthodox view of intellectual property licensing these days.  People get "licenses", but those licenses are features of "contracts", much as warranties are features of contracts.

> in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions,

In common law systems, which roughly trace those descended from English law, "consideration" doesn't mean consideration.  It's a legal term that stands in for a requirement that to make a normal contract, the parties to that contract need to exchange something of value.  That value is called "consideration".  It could be money.  It could be a promise, enforceable under contract law.  It could be very little.  But it has to be something.  Without "consideration", there is no contract in the usual sense.

> and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

The "consideration" concept leads to the question: What is the party giving the license getting out of this?  There isn't any money changing hands, so that can't be the answer.  And under many free license terms, there may or may not be any free-standing obligations on the part of the user or distributor, as distinct from _conditions_ that kick in if and only if they take certain actions, like .

Compare [Blue Oak Model 1.0.0](https://blueoakcouncil.org/licenses/1.0.0#acceptance):

> In order to receive this license, you must agree to its rules.  The rules of this license are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to your license.  You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule that you cannot or will not follow.
