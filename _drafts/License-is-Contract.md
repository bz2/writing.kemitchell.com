title: The License is a Contract
---

One of the new things the [Blue Oak Model License](https://blueoakcouncil.org/license/1.0.0) did was treat the wonkish "license versus contract" debate as uncertainty to avoid, rather than a hill to die on.  For a long time, especially free software activists advocated for treating the GPL and other licenses only as legal "licenses"---one-way grants of permission---and not as legal "contracts"---enforceable agreements between two sides.  Reading through Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) license again recently, I saw again just how far behind open software licensing remains, even compared to open licensing of other kinds of work.

The Creative Commons form has this language right at the top:

> By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License").  To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

How could anyone without legal training hope to make sense of this?  It must read like nonsense.  Let's take it apart.

> By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International Public License ("Public License").

Key Phrases: "accept", "agree to be bound". In lawyerspeak, this is contract vocabulary.  One side of a contract---one "party---"accepts" an offers of contract terms from the other.  By either offering or accepting, both parties "agree to be bound" by contract terms.

> To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract,...

Note: to this extent, and not beyond it.  In other words, you can read this as an "if".  _If_ the license is treated as a contract, _then_....

> ...You are granted the Licensed Rights

_If_ this is a contract, _then_ you get a license.

That is the orthodox theoretical view of how intellectual property licensing works these days.  People get "licenses", but those licenses come as features of "contracts", much as warranties come as features of contracts.  The license is what keeps you from getting sued for infringement and losing.  But the mechanism or vehicle for getting that license assigned to you, legally, is a contract.

> in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions,...

Read "in consideration of" as "in return for".

In common law systems, descended from English law, as opposed to civil law systems, descended from Roman law, "consideration" doesn't mean consideration, like being considerate.  It's a legal "term of art" that stands for a requirement that both sides of a deal give and take something of value in order to make their agreement a contract that courts will enforce.

The thing given or taken is the "consideration".  It could be money.  It could be rights in property.  It could be a promise you can take to court and enforce.  It could be very little, or entirely conditional on things that may or may not happen.  Courts won't (usually) balk if it's way less than what you gave---in other words, if you got a bad deal.  But consideration has to be _something_ with value the courts can recognize.  Without "consideration", there is no contract in the usual sense.

Accepting "terms and conditions" isn't terribly concrete, in terms of what the side giving valuable software away without fee gets in return.  And it's not up to the legal terms to say what does or doesn't count as consideration---that's a court's job, looking not just at the terms, but at the circumstances, too.  But it wouldn't make sense to say "in consideration of" anything in a license that did _not_ want to be read as a contract.  Consideration is a contract thing.

> ...and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

It's clear what the person getting the license gets out of a Creative Commons license.  They start _without_ permission for the work, and they end up with that permission.  So we see the emphasis on what the side _giving_ the license is getting out of it.  There isn't any money changing hands, so that can't be the answer.  And under many free license terms, there may or may not be any free-standing obligations on the part of the user or distributor, as distinct from _conditions_ that kick in if and only if they take certain actions, like .

> In order to receive this license, you must agree to its rules.  The rules of this license are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to your license.  You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule that you cannot or will not follow.
