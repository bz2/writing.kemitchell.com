Here in the United States, we are trying to talk about the chasm between rich and poor.  We are trying to talk about what to do about it.

We can see the scars of those battles in our language, in the words we use to describe the issue and approaches to it.  We can also see an odd bipartisanship.  The popular wings of both major parties have homed in on a new, common vocabulary of inequality.  We can trace that convergent evolution in the rhetoric of inequality over the last few years.

## Poverty

Rich people, as a rule, prefer to talk about "poverty".  "Poverty" puts the focus on what poor people do, rather than on what rich people do.  When rich people start foundations to help poor people, those foundations raise funds, start programs, and announce initiatives to combat "poverty".

For a long time, "poverty" was the name folks of all kinds, rich and poor, used for the subject.  For a long time, that name implied that poverty was a matter of what the poor do, or even a fixed state of being.  That some people are just poor and would be poor, but perhaps rich people might do something helpful about it.

## The One Percent

There are two sides we could blame for inequality.  "Poverty" covers one of them.  The leading term point not at the poor, but at the rich, is "the one percent".

"The one percent" is concrete: the wealthiest one percent of people, nationwide.  That concreteness scares very wealthy people.  They know where they stand, that they are being called out.

But "the one percent" also comforts many less wealthy people.  Those in the top two percent, the top five percent, the top ten percent and so on can find wealth distribution charts in Forbes, the New York Times, or on social media.  They can see what one percent means in dollars.  Knowing they have less, they're reassured they aren't part of the problem.  Or at least not part of the target.

In addition to shifting focus away from the poor, a phrase like "the one percent" splits the Very Rich away from the Just Rich.  It helps to move the Just Rich out of the way of reforms the Not Rich want, like progressive taxation of the Very Rich.

That makes "the one percent" good rhetoric.  But it does not make good sense.

The difference between the bottom ten percent and the top one percent is a difference of kind, not of degree.  Those are fundamentally different lives.  So is the difference between the fiftieth percentile and the top one percent.  The difference between the ninety-fifth percentile and the one percent, in wealth terms, is also enormous, in dollar terms.  But from the majority point of view, it's a difference of degree, not of kind.  The ninety-fifth percentile lives free of basic want, just like the one percent.  The ninety-fifth percentile doesn't suffer any less than the one percent.  They're just capable of less extravagance and influence.

The trouble "the one percent" ought to evoke isn't just a problem of static wealth.  It's a problem of how people get wealthy.  The difference between some of the top two percent, top five percent, or top ten percent and the top one percent often comes down to better starting points, better luck, and more time.  Some inherited less from their parents.  Some were less fortunate with what they had in their own time.  Some have been wealthy for fewer generations, compounding returns over shorter periods.  But many are playing the same games that mint the one percent.  Games that not only make the rich richer, but more people poor and poorer.

## Inequality

More recently, policy talk has shifted to "inequality".  "Inequality" focuses not on the rich, not on the poor, but on the difference between rich and poor.  It can point either way, or no way at all, in the blame game.

That makes the word a bit of a window.  If you're poor, "inequality" points to the rich.  If you're rich, "inequality" points to the poor.  But more than either, "inequality" makes the issue abstract.  "Inequality" begs a systemic view of the problems and systemic approaches to solutions.  Systemic views and approaches make the issue less personal.

"Inequality" is good thinking, and probably good framing for policy.  But it is also bad rhetoric.  "Equality" means too many things.

We see how that plays out all the time.  Even relatively conservative people end forced to make nuanced distinctions between "equality of opportunity" and "equality of outcome".  In policy, nuance is essential.  In rhetoric, nuance is weak.  So those in favor of change are all the time protesting that they don't want to level all mankind by force.  Their opponents are all the time insinuating they really do.

The term "inequality" points us to the right literature and research, but hobbles any insights we take back from it.  It puts academics, technocrats, and intellectuals in a kind of rhetorical playpen.  If you go looking for evidence one way or another, you probably use the search term "inequality" a lot.  But when it comes time to make an impact with that learning, you probably find yourself leaning back on "poverty" or "the one percent".

## The Search

We have an inequality problem.  We need policies to address it.  Where is the term that facilitates good discussion of the problem and good discussion of policies?

To capture the essential elements of the terms we've had so far, but escape their flaws, we'd need a new name for the issue.  One that honors its seriousness, but without taking sides in an oversimplifying blame game.  One that invites us to more systematic thinking, but without washing out the whole personal element.  One that avoids rhetorical weakness, but frames descriptions of what is wrong and proposals for what to do productively.  One that evokes the current state of affairs, but reflects that state as a predictable outcome of observable processes.  One that's familiar and understandable, but free of heavy associative baggage.  One that reassures those who could be collateral damage that they won't be targeted by simplistic, narrative-driven policies.

That's a tall order.  And a testament to how thoroughly politics have colonized our language.  English has more than one word for everything, but never, it seems, the right one.

There are a few candidates.

The Marxists say "oppression".  And that is a good word.  But its meaning has been mostly overshadowed by affiliation with Marxism.  Many Marxists wish that all would-be reformers would want what they want, see the problems as they see the problems.  They might welcome broader adoption of a name associated with their views.  But those views aren't terribly popular at the moment.

Notable industrialists and financiers have used "surplus wealth".  And that is a fine description in businesslike terms.  Suspiciously positive terms.  A surplus is good.  Wealth is good.  How can surplus wealth be bad?  Like "poverty", "surplus wealth" conveniently leaves the wealthy backstage.  It isn't the wealth's fault that it's surplus.

Students of government know the term "plutocracy", the subspecies of oligarchy dominated by the wealthy.  In my reading, this is the best fit.  Alas, "plutocracy" is also literally Greek.  The more general "oligarchy" is more familiar.  But "oligarchy" has the "equality" problem.  It could also mean a society ruled by the most worthy, or the most educated.

No dice.

## Rigged

Never to fear.  When our politics need a word, a word there will be.  If the language we have can't oblige, the language will be changed, a new word invented, to fill the void.  When it comes to inequality, we didn't have to go that far.

The new word for problems of systemic inequality is "rigged".  The economy is "rigged".  Our political system is "rigged".  The "system" is "rigged".  The winners are making the rules, by fair and foul.  The rules the winners make work out awfully good for the winners.

"Rigged", like "inequality", focuses on the systemic, rather than the personal.  "Rigged", like "the one percent", points mostly to the rich rather than the poor, but offers a kind of safe harbor for those who truly believe they earned what they have.  "Rigged" comes from the vernacular, not the jargon of Marxists or neoconversatives or political scientists.  "Rigged" cries out with indignance, but points in the right direction: the rules of the game and their enforcement, not individual players.

These quotes come from famous national politicians in the last few years:

> It's not just the political system that's rigged.  It's the whole economy.

> This is what a rigged and corrupt economy looks like...

Who do you suppose?  Care to guess?

The answer is [Donald Trump](https://money.cnn.com/2016/06/22/news/economy/donald-trump-rigged-economy/).  And also [Bernie Sanders](https://twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/1258781182109548544).  Both have adopted "rigged" as their language of the problem of inequality.  Both enjoy a boost in appeal from addressing and expressing the problem in this way.  Both leverage that appeal to support policy positions that do and don't seem to coincide with this root of their popularity.
