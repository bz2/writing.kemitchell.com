Nobody sees all of open source, or all of law.  Least of all me.  There is too much going on, in too many places, public and private, for anyone to take it all in.  Or to know whether their ride was representative.

It's worse than that.  Where we do have experience, limited as that must be, time served doesn't bestow a perfect picture of the past.  Memory just isn't that reliable.  It get worse, not better, as we go along.

Even when we do remember vividly, we can't separate what we remember from how we thought and felt about it in the moment.  Details we thought unimportant, for which we spared no attention, don't suddenly come walking out of the haze of recollection, perfectly clear, ready to meet us for the first time.

Revisiting my "open source" past has proven incredibly valuable over the years.  But also deeply dangerous.  The more I think about what I've seen and done, the less I feel I know.  At the same time, II trust the "open source guy" I used to be less and less all the time.  The words, concepts, heuristics, and defaults he relief upon, his vocabulary of software, business, intellectual property, and politics simply weren't that refined.  Mostly, they came secondhand, products of somebody else's experience.  A disturbing number were propaganda, good for someone else, but not necessarily for me or my clients.

The understandings of software and the Internet that dominated early on, when most people contributing to the Net, rather than just consuming it, were real or aspiring software nerds, haven't held their lead.  Where once "open source" represented the Way Things Work online, with little popular ideological opposition, those starting now tend to look elsewhere, and to different ideas, even if they end up as programmers.  Ideas about how how to collaborate.  Ideas about how to do business.  Ideas about how to build a name.  Ideas explaining what the Hell is going on.  Most successful projects, movements, and platforms have taken off quite without paying any dues to the open source creed, as platforms of yore often strained absurdly to do.  Even as they've been happy to use open software.  There's less and less need for those driving the "information superhighway" to look under a hood.

With the kids these days looking first to social media, streaming services, e-commerce platforms, and the like for their big ideas and osmotic lessons, what's an old man of the forum, mailing list, and conference set to do?  Keep the old faith, speak the true catechism, and take pity on the eye-rolling youth who just don't get it, and wait?  Dial up my missionary game, write more pamphlets, and hit the lecture circuit?

On the law side of things, the answer was far more clear.  American contract drafting is a morass of high intelligence, big energy, historical momentum, and lazy repetition.  It's easier and more comfortable for lawyers to read and write a bunch of jargon, obscurantism, and archaisms, than to remember how they used to write before law school.  But apart from earning the approval of one's legal peers, that's a recipe for rather terrible contracts, from courts' and clients' points of view.

Step One: Make out lists of jargon, [archaism](https://github.com/kemitchell/american-legal-archaisms/blob/master/index.json), and [prolix](https://github.com/kemitchell/wordy-words/blob/master/index.json).  Step Two: Banish them from speech, writing, and subconscious thought.  When a word people actually use these days will do, use that word instead.  When a shorter, friendlier phrase will say the bit, say it thattaway.  When a technical concept comes up, explain it in English.  If you must name the term, put it in scare quotes, so folks know what they're dealing with.

This is very difficult, and takes a lot of discipline.  It takes a lot of time you won't always have, in the fray.  But the payoff's incomparable. You begin to discover you didn't always really know what you were talking about, because you had expert-sounding words and phrases to hide behind.  You start to have a lot better conversations with clients, because you now seem vaguely approachable.  Their minds weren't warped by years of legal education.  You begin to hammer yours back straight.

We could do the same for "open source".  Instead of working "open source" into every conversation possible, as beginning and end, and getting nowhere, I find it far more difficult, and eventually freeing, to do the opposite.

Pick a week, and avoid all of the following words in all conversation and writing about software:

- "open"
- "free software"
- "software freedom"
- "proprietary"
- "hacker"
- "public domain"
- "closed"
- "collaboration"
- "BDFL"
- "copyleft"
- "permissive"
- "sustainability"
