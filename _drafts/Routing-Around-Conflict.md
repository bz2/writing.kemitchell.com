> **Corleone**:  How did things ever get so far?  I don't know.  It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.  Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.  We're quits.  And if Tattaglia agrees, then I'm willing to let things go on the way they were before.
>
> **Barzini**:  We're all grateful to Don Corleone for calling this meeting.  We all know him as a man of his word, a modest man.  He'll always listen to reason.
>
> **Tattaglia**:  Yes, Don Barzini.  He's too modest.  He had all the judges and politicians in his pocket.  He refused to share them.
>
> **Corleone**:  When ... when did I ever refuse an accommodation?  All of you know me here.  When did I ever refuse?  Except one time.  And why?  Because I believe this drug business is gonna destroy us in the years to come. [...]
>
> **Barzini**:  Times have changed.  It's not like the old days, when we could do anything we want.  A refusal is not the act of a friend.  [...]  He must let us draw the water from the well.  Certainly he can present a bill for such services.  After all, we are not Communists.

> [...]
>
> **Corleone**:  I hope that we could come here and reason together.  And as a reasonable man I'm willing to do whatever's necessary to find a peaceful solution to these problems.
>
> [...]
>
> **Barzini**:  Then we're agreed. [...] [T]here will be the peace
>
> **Tattaglia**:  But I must have strict assurances from Corleone.  As time goes by and his position becomes stronger, will he attempt any individual vendetta?
>
> **Barzini**:  Look.  We are all reasonable men here.  We don't have to give assurances as if we were lawyers.
