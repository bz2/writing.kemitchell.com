> # Agreement to Allow the Provision of Water to Individuals Who are Unhoused, Unsheltered, or Experiencing Homelessness through the East Bay Municipal Utility District Water Meter Serving [Address, Street, City, Parcel Number]
>
> This agreement is made this \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 20\_\_, by and between [CUSTOMER NAME ON ACCOUNT] ("Applicant") and EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT ("District").
>
> A.  Section 19 of the District's Regulations Governing Water Service to Customers ("Section 19") provides as follows:
>
> > More than one premises will not be served from a single meter. This provision will apply where two or more adjoining premises are owned by the same person. The Customer shall not permit the use of any of the water serviced by him from the District on any premises other than those specified in his application for service. No water received from the District may be resold without special approval from the District. B. Applicant is the existing District customer of record at \[Address, Street, City, APN\] ("the Premises"). District delivers water to the Premises through a water meter located on the Premises frontage on [street name]. Water delivered to the Premises by District is referred to in this Agreement as District Water.

This is the rule we called out in our [open letter to EBMUD](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2020/11/27/EBMUD-for-All.html) as potentially prohibiting sharing water with homeless neighbors.

> C.  Pursuant to Section 19, Applicant has requested special District approval to provide District Water to individuals who are unhoused, unsheltered, or experiencing homelessness.

> D.  District is willing to enter into this Agreement granting such special approval, provided that Applicant bears all risks and expenses thereof and reimburses District for any costs which it incurs in connection with such work, all in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

This is actually a pretty fair summary of what these terms are doing.  EBMUD is giving permission to share water, despite the rule against that.  But in return, EBMUD wants to be totally covered for any problems that come due to that sharing.

> NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do agree as follows:
>
> 1\.  _Limitations on Provision of District Water_. For a period of up to twelve months from the date of entry into this Agreement (Agreement Term), Applicant may provide District Water to individuals who are unhoused, unsheltered, or experiencing homelessness, provided that:

This special deal giving permission to share only lasts one year.  After that, you'll need to renew if you keep sharing water.  There's no guarantee in these terms that EBMUD will continue countersigning these kinds of contracts.

> a. For each billing period during the Agreement Term, the volume of District Water delivered to the Premises shall not exceed an average of (Determined By the District) \_\_\_\_ gallons per day; and Agreement to allow provisional water service to unsheltered individuals #\_\_\_\_

Note that this is an _average_ volume per day.  If you're only doing water deliveries weekly, and your limit here is ten gallons a day, you'd be fine filling up a hundred gallons of containers four times a month.

> b. Applicant shall only provide District Water to individuals who are unhoused, unsheltered, or experiencing homelessness within the District's Service Area,\[Footnote: A map of the District's Service Area is attached to this agreement as Exhibit A.\] and only for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes.

This was expected.  EBMUD can't do deals that involve moving water out of its district into somebody else's.

The "human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes" line comes directly from California Water Code section 106.3(a), which declares it state policy that "every human being has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes".

> 2\.  _Method of Delivery_. Applicant shall use its own container to provide District Water to others pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Applicant shall not provide District Water to others using a direct connection to the Premises such as through a hose, piping, or other plumbing apparatuses. To ensure compliance with this paragraph, District shall have the right to inspect the Premises upon 24 hours' notice. If Applicant violates the requirements of this paragraph, District's right of inspection shall survive termination of this Agreement.

I would read this to prohibit, say, running a hose from your house's hose bib out to a nearby camp.  I would _not_ read it to prohibit filling up containers and taking them to homeless people, or even allowing homeless folks to fill up containers at your hose bib.

> 3\.  _Costs_. Applicant is responsible for all costs associated with its provision of District Water to others pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to payment for District Water according to the District's Schedules of Rates and Charges, costs of transporting water, costs associated with maintaining water quality and safety, and any other associated costs.

Expected.  EBMUD isn't paying for any sharing here.  It's just allowing it to happen.

> 4\.  _Legal and Regulatory Compliance_. Applicant is responsible for obtaining all necessary permits and complying with all legal requirements pertaining to Applicant's provision of water for human consumption, including but not limited to the requirements set forth in Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations.

> 5\.  _Violations_. Upon receipt of notice from the District that Applicant is in violation of (1) any part of this Agreement, and/or (2) the District's Regulations Governing Water Service to Customers, Applicant shall immediately remedy the violation. Failure to timely remedy any such violation may result in discontinuation of District water service to the Premises. Applicant shall pay any fees, charges, or costs incurred by the District as a result of its efforts to remedy any such violations.

> 6\.  _Indemnity_. Applicant expressly agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless District and its Directors, officers, agents and employees from and against any and all loss, liability, expenses, claims, suits, and damages, including attorneys' fees, arising out of, or pertaining to, or relating to or resulting from Applicant's operation and/or performance under this Agreement.

This is the big one.  Pay attention to this part.

"Indemnify" is a fancy legal term for "pay for".  Think of indemnity like an insurance policy between two private parties.  Basically, this section says that if sharing water causes a legal problem, like a lawsuit or regulatory inquiry, and EBMUD gets roped into that process, you will cover EBMUD's costs of working it out.

> 7\.  _Release_. Applicant hereby voluntarily releases, discharges, waives, and covenants not to sue District, its directors, officers, agents, and employees (RELEASEES) for any and all harm, loss, liability, expense, claims, action, suits, and damages, including attorney's fees, arising out of, or pertaining to, or relating to or resulting from Applicant's operation and/or performance under this Agreement.

This is the part where you let EBMUD totally off the hook for any problems related to sharing water.  Water quality, availability, and all the rest will be your responsibility, and not EBMUD's.

> 8\.  _Assumption of Risk_. Applicant is aware of the risks inherent in their operation and/or performance under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks associated with providing water for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes. Applicant voluntarily accepts all such risks.

> 9\.  **Applicant has read this agreement and understands it contains a release and waiver of all claims. Applicant further understands that it assumes all risks inherent in its performance and/or operation under this agreement, including but not limited to all risks associated with providing water for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes. By executing this agreement, applicant voluntarily accepts all of the above provisions.**

This text is actually set in ALL CAPITALS on the form, but that just makes it hard to read.

> 10\.  _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated by DISTRICT immediately for cause or upon 10 days written notice, without cause. This Agreement may also be terminated through mutual written consent of both parties.

EBMUD can end your permission under this agreement to share water at any time, for no reason.  They just have to give you ten days' advance notice.

> 11\.  _Agreement Term_. This Agreement shall be effective upon execution by both parties and, unless terminated pursuant to paragraph 10 herein, shall terminate twelve months following the date of the second signature below. Paragraphs 6-9 hall survive the termination of this Agreement.

> 12\.  _Integration_. This Agreement represents the entire understanding of District and Applicant as to those matters contained herein. No prior oral or written understanding shall be of any force or effect with respect to those matters covered hereunder. This Agreement may only be modified by amendment in writing signed by each party.

> 13\.  _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement is to be binding on the successors and assigns of the parties hereto. Applicant shall not assign, transfer or otherwise substitute its interest in this Agreement or any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of District.

> 14\.  _Severability_. Should any part of this Agreement be declared by a final decision by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, invalid or beyond the authority of either party to enter into or carry out, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect, provided that the remainder of this Agreement can be interpreted to give effect to the intentions of the parties.

> 15\.  _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with, and governed in all respects by, California Law.

> 16\.  _Waiver_. The District's waiver of the performance of any covenant, condition, obligation, representation, warranty or promise in this agreement shall not invalidate this Agreement or be deemed a waiver of any other covenant, condition, obligation, representation, warranty or promise. The District's waiver of the time for performing any act or condition hereunder does not constitute a waiver of the act or condition itself.
