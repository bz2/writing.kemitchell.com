title: Open Source Discriminates Against Closed

Open source discriminates against closed software.  That was the point.  But that's now what you'll hear these days.  Or rather, that's not what you'll hear from the major foundations and "open source professionals".

These days, if a new open source license comes along that requires openness, but openness isn't good for you, your clients, or your company, it's easy enough to attack it as "not open source".

Just follow three easy steps.

## How To Shun a License

**Step One**:  Pick a vague, high-sounding section from the ["Open Source Definition"](https://opensource.org/osd).  Avoid the ones about specific needs of Linux distributions, like [section 9](https://opensource.org/osd#not-restrict-other-software).  Go for the [glittering generalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glittering_generality), like [section 5](https://opensource.org/osd#persons-or-groups) or [section 6](https://opensource.org/osd#fields-of-endeavor), the rules against "discrimination" toward "fields of endeavor" and "persons or groups".

**Step Two**:  Argue that the license discriminates against (is bad for) what you want to do---the "field of endeavor" of making closed software---or for you or your company---the "persons or groups" who are proprietary software developers and companies.  If the terms of the license make that distinction, argue that.  If the terms don't make that distinction, argue they'll have that effect in practice.  If it's not clear they'll have that effect in practice, argue that's what the author of the license secretly intends.

**Step Three**:  When the author of the license counters that the section you cite is vague, that your reading is forced, that other important documents of free and open history contradict your line, that the Open Source Initiative and Free Software Foundation have approved or even written licenses that would violate your interpretation, or that the license should be judged standing on its own, and not based on what bad things you say about them, ignore it all.  Declare there's no "consensus" that the license is open source, because other people just like you disagree.  Do what you can to cast the author as an outsider, a usurper, an attacker upon the "community".

This is not a new play.  It's been run many times, by many players.  It's not even the oldest in the book, but it's by far the most popular.

## Telling the Difference

Part of the power of this play is that the nondiscrimination bits of the Open Source Definition have such a shiny, high-minded appeal to them.  "Discrimination" has a bad ring to it these days, because we associate it with gender, racial, religious, sexual, and other kinds of deplorable social oppression.  Who isn't against discrimination?  Isn't open source good for standing strong against it?

Oppression requires discrimination, but oppression and discrimination aren't the same.  Discrimination, without oppression, is good.  It's often critically necessary.

To _oppress_, say, black people, selfish, amoral people have to [decide that racism will be profitable, propound "black people" as a valid category, and _discriminate_ to determine who does and doesn't belong](https://www.ibramxkendi.com/stamped-from-the-beginning/).  Having made that distinction, society can _then_ oppress those it has set apart for exploitation, which will in turn convince more people that  the distinction is right.  Another, better society might _uplift_ black people instead, to offset the oppression they've suffered for so long.  But that would still require discriminating.  Who do we uplift?

The word "discrimination" used to have a nobler ring to it, closer to what we now feel about "discernment".   A "discerning person" is one who can tell the difference---discriminate---when the difference matters.  Between good and bad quality.  Between truth and self-serving sales jabber.  Between strong and weak argument.  Between just and unjust outcomes.  Between right and wrong conduct.  It is hard to get one over on a discerning person.

That is exactly what "free software" and "open source" tried to teach hackers and businesspeople.  There wasn't just "software".  There was "open" or "free" software, on the one hand, and "closed" or "proprietary" software on the other.  Free and open software was good.  Closed and proprietary software was bad.  Don't be fooled.

Having learned to see and decide between open and closed, free and proprietary, good and bad, hackers and businesspeople could choose to make open software, choose to use open software, choose to support open software, choose to promote open software.  None of that would be good for closed software.  After all, software could not be both open and closed.  Once you saw the difference, you had to make a choice.

## Change

The starkness of that black-and-white view, and the speed with which it seized minds in the early days of Internet 2.0, produced some memes that border on the laughable now.

Microsoft?  [Evil.](https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/campaigns-summaries#upgrade-from-windows)  SCO.  [Evil.](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/sco/sco-gnu-linux.html)  Tivo?

A few of these companies make their core product or service open source.  The vast majority use open source to make a product or service that is closed.

But in the new manner of speaking, open source has "won".  Nearly all software is open source, in the sense that it builds on open source, uses open source tools, relies on open source infrastructure.  But that is just the opposite of the principled discrimination we saw before.  There was no "software", all of the same kind.  Software was _either_ open or closed.  It could not be both.  If you had to make closed software, perhaps to pay the bills, that was regrettable, guilty, and wrong.

## Regulatory Capture

It's not open source if Red Hat can't beat you out for enterprise hosting and support contracts.

It's not open source if IBM can't integrate and resell it.

It's not open source if AWS can't offer it as a first-party managed service.

It's not open source if it can't got on GitHub, where [anyone can fork it, even privately](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#5-license-grant-to-other-users).
