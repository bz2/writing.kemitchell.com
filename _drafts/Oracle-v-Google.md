You don't have to be an intellectual property hawk or clueless non-coder to have serious misgivings about _Oracle v. Google_.  I grew up programming, reading Larry Lessig, and running Linux.  Now I'm a lawyer, and advise a lot on open source.  I've read the Supreme Court opinions several times.  If anything, the universal industry-side acclaim for the decision---at least in the corners I lurk in---only deepens the queasy feeling I've had since the opinion went up on [supremecourt.gov](https://supremecourt.gov).

On the industry side, I'm not totally sure this was a good result.

On the legal side, I'm pretty sure it was a bad decision.

To address the obvious first, a lot of the headlines and comment-section summaries get the decision wrong.  The Supreme Court didn't say application programming interfaces can't be copyrighted.  It assumed they _can_, and let an earlier appeals court decision saying as much stand.  Instead, six out of eight justices hearing the case agreed that fair use, one of the "defenses" that lets you off even if you did commit copyright infringement, lets Android off for copying Java APIs and writing their own implementations.

The lawyers definitely won, after fifteen years and gobs of billable hours.  Google also won, if you don't think too much about the lawyers.  It's less clear who else this decision will be good for, or why.  Especially if you look beyond possible disruption---remember that word?---to the Android ecosystem.

It's a gamble to declare the current state of coverage on an issue biased, then set out to restore balance to the universe single-handedly.  That usually leads to something even more unbalanced than any of the individual takes you're complaining about in aggregate, but on the opposite slant, and far more concentrated.  Inevitably, some people will read just your bit, or take just your bit seriously, and become a monster.

Frankly, though, I think I'm with many of my colleagues here.  Apart from Clarence Thomas's dissent, which I've no interest in repeating, I've seen some knee-jerk, copyright maximalist takes, and not much more.

I'll bite.

## Fair Use

[Fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) at the Supreme Court level is basically [Calvinball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_and_Hobbes#Calvinball).  Unless the rest of the government comes along and changes [the fair use part of the Copyright Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2019-title17/USCODE-2019-title17-chap1-sec107), which was just Congress trying to write out what courts were already doing at the time, the Supreme Court makes the rules about what is and isn't fair use up as it goes along.  The court doesn't _have_ to hear any particular case about fair use.  So when it does, "fair use" often means something different coming out than it did going in.

The Supreme Court doesn't take that many fair use cases.  That partly explains the problem with fair use: the form of the rule represents the least code-like kind of law we have, and Supremes don't give us many [test vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_vector) to check what's going on down below.  Known as a ["factor test" or "balancing test"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balancing_test), fair use doesn't boil down to ["bright-line"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright-line_rule), if-then kinds of statements, but a list of factors, or prompts, that courts are supposed to remember to think about, toss into the pot, sprinkle with a hefty seasoning of judgment, and [stir up good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AER7cAiN4g0).  Lower court judges are supposed to watch how higher-ups do it, then follow along, under supervision.  When the two sides fighting have the time and money to keep going to trial and filing appeals, as they rarely do, we often see histories like _Oracle v. Google_, where perfectly competent judges, up and down the hierarchy, completely disagree with each other.

For people and companies who aren't federal judges, this makes fair use incredibly hard to rely on.  Especially outside situations that have already come up lots of times in relatively established media, like book reviews quoting novels, or in industries where repeat players and specialists establish their own rules over time, [like film and TV, where insurance companies write policies to cover copyright lawsuits](https://www.amazon.com/Clearance-Copyright-4th-Everything-Television/dp/1935247123).  Even in cases that seem to point strongly one way or the other, the open-endedness of fair use opens the ends of litigation about fair use.  That means court costs, attorneys' fees, and time delays that very few can possibly pay.  It takes a real battle of titans, like Oracle and Google, with a big prize at stake, like royalties on Android, to make new law on these things.

For people who _are_ federal judges, all this unpredictable wishy-wash---"flexible" factor test, "case-by-case" analysis, judicious "balancing"---means that much more of a free hand to make public policy.  Especially at the Supreme Court.

The contrast with rules about what can be copyrighted says a lot.  Those rules _do_ tend to take if-then form, often spelled out explicitly in the Copyright Act.  Even some of the vaguer concepts referenced in those rules, like the requirement that copyrightable work must be "creative", have developed toward more predictability in time.  We lawyers can't say exactly what the threshold for minimum creativity is, in if-then terms.  But we know it's really, really low.  If a person did the creating, rather than, say, a machine or a [monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie_copyright_dispute), it's probably copyrightable.

I can't help coming away from the Supreme Court's written opinion thinking that at least some justices wanted to say APIs can't be copyrighted, but didn't think they could rationalize that as interpreting the Copyright Law Congress passed, rather than making up their own.  So they looked to the part of copyright law where Congress basically gave them some hints and told them to work it out, fair use, reached the result they wanted to reach, then littered their opinion with all kinds of odd caveats that this decision is special and shouldn't affect the rest of fair use.

Basically, the Supreme Court took copyright law to the rework station, [MacGyverer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver) in one ugly hack of a bypass, complete with bare wires and a chip taped to the board, doused it with alcohol, scrubbed away the flux, and potted the bodge in black goo, to keep its heretical emanations away from the rest of the board.  Or, if you prefer:

```diff
  def fair_use (work, use_case):
+   if work.declaring_code and use_case.androidish:
+     return true
+   else:
+     return old_fair_use(work, use_case)
+
+ def old_fair_use(work, use_case):
    # https://copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html
    # 17 U.S.C. 107
    # &c. &c. &c.
```

If it looks like a back door, that's because it is.

The question is that `if` statement.  Does the rule of this case apply to _all_ declaring code, just declaring code that lots of programmers have invested in learning, just declaring code in programming language standard libraries, just declaring code in Java's?  Does the rule apply to all uses of that declaring code, just uses in arguably novel computing platforms, just Android or very Android-like things?  The folks who think copyright should last forever and crush all beneath it are pushing to frame this as a one-off.  Others have doubtless green-lit projects to yoink their competitor's APIs.  Lawyers gonna get paid.

A couple for those lawyers, while they're waiting:

Name another _kind_ of work where copyright applies, but fair use makes that protection practically irrelevant.

Name another Supreme Court decision where the majority explicitly _assumes_ a prerequisite legal conclusion, then explicitly tries to leave that question open as a matter of doctrinally.

## Bad Metaphors

After the lawyers argued this case in court, I [blogged a list of the many metaphors](https://writing.kemitchell.com/2020/10/12/Oracle-Google-Metaphors.html) the lawyers and justices bandied about.  Competitive comparison continue in the opinions.  From the majority:

- factory floor stocked with tools
- gas pedal (in a car)
- QWERTY keyboard layout (on ... a typewriter)

Compare Clarence Thomas, in dissent:

> Like many programming languages, Java allows developers to prewrite small subprograms called "methods."  Methods form the building blocks of more complex programs. This process is not unlike what legislatures do with statutes.  To save space and time, legislatures define terms and then use those definitions as a shorthand. For example, the legal definition for "refugee" is more than 300 words long.  [8 U.S.C. ยง 1101](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCODE-2019-title8/USCODE-2019-title8-chap12-subchapI-sec1101)(42).  Rather than repeat all those words every time they are relevant, the U.S. Code encapsulates them all with a single term that it then inserts into each relevant section. Java methods work similarly.  Once a method has been defined, a developer need only type a few characters (the method name and relevant inputs) to invoke everything contained in the subprogram.  A programmer familiar with prewritten methods can string many of them together to quickly develop complicated programs without having to write from scratch all the basic subprograms.

And later, addressing programmer familiarity:

> Many other copyrighted works depend on the same.  A Broadway musical script needs actors and singers to invest time learning and rehearsing it.  But a theater cannot copy a script---the rights to which are held by a smaller theater---simply because it wants to entice actors to switch theaters and because copying the script is more efficient than requiring the actors to learn a new one.

I'm no Clarence Thomas fan.  I'm no musical theater aficionado, like [Antonin Scalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin_Scalia), Thomas' judicial pal, either.  But I have learned and played a few parts in plays, in a couple languages.  I've learned a number of programming languages, Java among them.  But I have to admit that I think Thomas groks it.  If the majority does, they picked some lousy, leading metaphors.

## Dumbing it Down, Keeping it There

One explanation for the way the majority chose to portray API usage, among many, stems from the way those involved in the case chose to explain APIs to judges.  They chose to dumb it down.

The majority mentions `java.lang.Math.max`.  The dissent quotes a hypothetical implementation of a similar method in full:

```java
public static int MaxNum (int x, int y, int z) {
  if (x >= y && x >= z) return x;
  else if (y >= x && y >= z) return y;
  else return z;
}
```

The amicus brief of "83 computer scientists" focuses on `sort` for integers, in order to say more about different implementations.

I see no clear sign in the opinions that the Supreme Court justices got much further than this.  Certainly, some Java APIs are rather rudimentary, low-level operations.  And there remain viable legal questions about whether some of those, like `max` of `a` and `b`, are derivative of prior work, or too rote or formulaic for copyright protection.  There are fewer such questions about higher-level and more innovative APIs.  APIs that deal with memory, with process management, with with streams, with reflection.  The way that some APIs build on other APIs, not in implementation, but for types and other abstractions.  They way that aspects of the Java language proper flow through, and were creatively exposed, by core libraries.

`max` and `sort` are nice, day-one, napkin-sketch introductions to Java and Java APIs.  Stopping there leaves a woefully underdeveloped picture of what APIs are and do, not just in Java, but more generally.  There is very little of the complexity, abstraction, or creativity of API design there, apart from flow flows up from the real and virtual machine.

## Inextricable, Extricated

<!-- "inextricable" declaring code and implementing code handily extricated by Google -->
<!-- use of API by programmer v. use of API on a new platform -->
<!-- many users of big APIs versus independent producers of small APIs -->
<!-- Wishy-Washy on Market Factor -->
