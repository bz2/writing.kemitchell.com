title: Oracle v. Google
---

You don't have to be an intellectual property maximalist, or a clueless non-programmer, to be seriously disappointed in the United States Supreme Court's decision in _Oracle v. Google_.

<!-- it's a hack, which the court attempts to isolate from the rest of its copyright program -->
<!-- the dissent had the better metaphors -->
<!-- many users of big APIs versus independent producers of small APIs -->
<!-- "inextricable" declaring code and implementing code handily extricated by Google -->
<!-- Developing alternative not impossible. Apple did it. Microsoft did it. The dissent acknowledge this. The majority does not. -->
<!-- use of API by programmer v. use of API on a new platform -->
<!-- Wishy-Washy on Market Factor -->
<!-- not a decision on API copyrightability -->
