When software's "open source" you can treat it like you wrote it, even though you didn't.  You don't need permission from anyone to use it, share it, crib from it, build on it.  If something goes wrong, there's only you to blame.

There you have it, ladies and gentlemen, your brand new, short and simple definition of "open source" for 2021.  Or at least, there's your definition of "open source" as some---and the vast majority of businesses---want it to be.

If you're thinking "open source" sounds an awful lot like "software in the public domain", you're right.  But we don't really care about the legal detail of "dedication to the public domain", or whether that's a thing.  We care about how we can treat the software, once all the things have been done to it.  End, not means.

Excited yet?  Stop.  I don't recommend that anyone run out and apply this definition of "open source".  I certainly don't recommend writing it into legal terms or policy documents.  In fact, I recommend very strongly against it.  Not because it's a bad definition.  Because defining "open source" is itself a bad idea.

We're not specifying a plug to fit in a socket.  We're not expressing any kind of mathematical property.  We're talking about a movement.  A vague, common understanding among meat-people who occasionally publish software.  Jazz, Rock 'n Roll, and Hip Hop do not need or benefit from definitions.  Neither do political movements.  Neither do fashion trends.  If you're trying to "define" these things, rather than express their history, you're doing it wrong.

The value of a short and simple definition of "open source" is tool value.  We can find a definition we really like, that really speaks to us, apply it to reality, and see where it fails.
