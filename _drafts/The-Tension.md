Read, muddle, and stir:

<p markdown="1">And therefore, if the established powers are sensitive and well-informed, if they are visibly trying to meet popular feeling, and actually removing some of the causes of dissatisfaction, no matter how slowly they proceed, provided they are seen to be proceeding, they have little to fear.  It take stupendous and persistent blundering, plus almost infinite tactlessness, to start a revolution from below.  Palace revolutions, interdepartmental revolutions, are a different matter.  So, too, is demagogy.  That stops at relieving the tension by expressing the feeling.  But the statesman knows that such relief is temporary, and if indulged too often, unsanitary.  He, therefore, sees to it that he arouses no feeling which he cannot sluice into a program that deals with the facts to which the feelings refer.</p>

<!--  We had an election that was stolen from us.  It was a <em>landslide</em> election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side.  But you have to go home now.  We have to have peace.

There's never been a time like this, where such a thing happened, where they could take it away, from all of us, from me, from you, from our country.  This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people.  We have to have peace.  So go home.</p>-->

And lest we forget there is poetry in our language:

<blockquote>

  <dd>In ancient times, a leader of the people; a popular leader or orator who espoused the cause of the people against any other party in the state.</dd>
  <dd>In bad sense: A leader of a popular faction, or of the mob; a political agitator who appeals to the passions and prejudices of the mob in order to obtain power or further his own interests; an unprincipled or factious popular orator.</dd>

Bookends.

That this week's political events _bother_ me comes as an unwelcome and humbling surprise.  These events were symbolic.  They were photogenic.  They were dramatic.  They were shallow and intuitive.  In short, media schlock of the first order.  Fodder for the news.  Dross, or trivia, for the histories.

I suspect these events will matter little or at all, beyond our shared recollection, in a month or two.  I see nothing of material national importance that has suffered real damage.  Apart from the lives lost, which will surely bring a great deal of true pain for those personally connected, there is little to mourn as a matter public affairs, as distinct from private ones.

The blow fell instead on our perceptions.  It defiled what feelings of sanctity we may have left for the federal government, or at least its iconic seat, where the blessed work of democracy is supposed to get done.  There were people in chambers of Congress who did not belong there, were not invited, and showed themselves in by force---laughably little force---and a lot of brouhaha.

Because they lost an election, and readily accepted that couldn't be the case.  Because they had been pointed that way.  But having made it so far, they seemed as surprised as anyone they hadn't been stopped.  They evidenced no particular plan, nor any capacity to concoct one.  They posed for pictures.  Incriminating pictures.

Thanks to them, I am learning I harbored more sentimentalism about the Capitol than I thought.  More than I now like to admit.  On those latent heartstrings, the crowd struck its haphazard, petulant, dissonant chord, like an infantile drunk banging one out on the bar's upright piano as the bouncer drags him to the door.

I am glad the presidential election is over, and that someone else will take office this year.  I don't particularly look forward to Biden.  I look forward to passably competent administration.

Biden will have the bureaucratic machinery of his party, the big hat of Approved Persons from which to draw names for this and that, which only the major parties credibly possess.  He won't fill gaps with unqualified relations, or sulk back to uneasy party members to fill gaps.  He won't leave desks in the bowels of critical public apparatus vacant for months on end.

I do not look forward with unalloyed bliss to the ends restored competence will serve.  I've had a look at Joe's record, and it is what it is.  His brand of bipartisanship, on the matters I've studied, bespeaks a deeply entrenched reflex to lick a thumb, stick it to the wind, and care little whence it blows, as long as it blows.  He's been around long enough to make mistakes, inevitably.  But some of those worst are the pressing problems of today, our contorted criminal justice system among them.  'Twas a time when "law and order" was _his_ brand, snatched from Republicans who come running not as fast when they heard the whistle.

In throwing open his party's administrative stable, Biden will welcome its fashions, pettinesses, fealties, corruptions, and debts to trod over government, as well.  I do not look forward to learning what other hopeful expectations I may have left for him, by means of the inevitable disappointments that will bring them to light.  I do not look forward to the encouragement his inauguration will lend those in worn seats of Democratic Party power, who picked Biden the Bland before the rest of us got a choice.  I have not enjoyed reading the ivy-consulting-think-tank-bank bios of so many of his appointees, or how much they've made "speaking" to firms they will now regulate.

In short, I know American political par, and I am hardly inspired.  From bad to bluster to bad again might represent progress, but only if you draw the timeline very short.  Only if you assume the bad we had before had nothing to do with the chaos that temporarily disrupted it.

I fear, most of all, that the party of the victors will allow the vanquishing of Trump, Notorious Personality, to substitute for victory over the meaningful conditions that contributed to his rise.  That they will personalize politics, as they tend to do whenever it suits them, and conclude that slaying the demagogue means banishing all the grievances he so ably channeled, and so completely failed to address, from political relevance.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is where backlash comes from.  Because not all those grievances were racist, fascist, or crazy.

There is no Single Unified Theory of Trump Support.  Even among those grazing in a daze about the chambers of Congress this week, one would doubtless find wide variation, both in what Trump seems to them to be and why they support it, if indeed they do.  But among Trump's supporters---in their millions---there are those who desperately sought, and rapturously celebrated, a politician on the national stage finally willing to name and declaim just how much intolerable shit the disposable heroes of American defense and labor left behind in the past five decades have had to take.

There are whole families in this country, once self-sufficient, now cast out of every empowered vision of progress.  Down at the bottom, they cannot reach even the first rungs of the ladder out of the mud.  They mull about the bottom of the great economic pit of our society, having slid off the end of the steep, slippery slope at the back end.  They are picked off, one by one, by a flock of carrion industries circling overhead---food, financial, medical, housing---who bother to pick the last fiscal and political gristle from their bones, and see any con within the rules they scheme to define as socially beneficial.

Temp and contract labor.  Medical bills and opioid addiction.  Degenerate foodstuffs.  Payday loans.  Title debt.  Rent-to-own.  Lotteries, gambling, and adjacent gamifications.  Contract sales and "innovative" mortgages.  Student loans at predatory institutions.  The latest crypto scam.  It recalls nothing so well as a muted aftershock of our country's policy toward former slaves after Reconstruction, as the economy of rural and small-town America lay its cornerstones on new labor.  Now it has rebuilt again, without the need of the local 8-to-5 working man, whatever color he may be.

But for all this, I remain mutely and self-defensively optimistic, on tentative balance.  Because there is a chance, a fleeting chance, that we might have a government that does things again.

We all know the issues.  Healthcare.  Immigration.  Tax reform.  Drug policy.  Electoral engineering.  Law enforcement.  Education.  Reading any bill Congress manages on these issues will be impossible.  Excerpts picked out by the better press and Wikipedia will disappoint us.  But any possible return to reelection by legislative record, rather than reelection by rhetoric, is hopeful.

We've heard the "mob's" cry, and it was much the same as from reasonable, workaday people.  It would be nice to hear less about it, and see more done.
