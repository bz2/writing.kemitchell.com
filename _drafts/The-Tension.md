Mix, muddle, and stir:

<p markdown="1">And therefore, if the established powers are sensitive and well-informed, if they are visibly trying to meet popular feeling, and actually removing some of the causes of dissatisfaction, no matter how slowly they proceed, provided they are seen to be proceeding, they have little to fear.  It take stupendous and persistent blundering, plus almost infinite tactlessness, to start a revolution from below.  Palace revolutions, interdepartmental revolutions, are a different matter.  So, too, is demagogy.  That stops at relieving the tension by expressing the feeling.  But the statesman knows that such relief is temporary, and if indulged too often, unsanitary.  He, therefore, sees to it that he arouses no feeling which he cannot sluice into a program that deals with the facts to which the feelings refer.</p>

  <dd>In ancient times, a leader of the people; a popular leader or orator who espoused the cause of the people against any other party in the state.</dd>
  <dd>In bad sense: A leader of a popular faction, or of the mob; a political agitator who appeals to the passions and prejudices of the mob in order to obtain power or further his own interests; an unprincipled or factious popular orator.</dd>

Bookends.

That this week's political events _bother_ me comes as an unwelcome and humbling surprise.  These events were symbolic.  They were photogenic.  They were dramatic.  They were shallow and intuitive.  In short, media schlock of the first order.  Fodder for the news.  Dross, or trivia, for the histories.

I suspect these events will matter little or at all, beyond our shared recollection, in a month or two.  I see nothing of material national importance that has suffered real damage.  Apart from the lives lost, which will surely bring a great deal of true pain for those personally connected, there is little to mourn as a matter public affairs, distinct from solemn private ones.

The blow fell instead on our perceptions.  It defiled what feelings of sanctity we may have left for the federal government, or at least its iconic seat, where the blessed work of democracy is supposed to get done.  There were people in chambers of Congress who did not belong there, were not invited, and showed themselves in by force---laughably little force---and a lot of brouhaha.  They trashed the place.

Because they lost an election, and preferred to accept a version of events where that wasn't the case.  Because they had been pointed that way.  But having made it so far, they seemed as surprised as anyone they hadn't been stopped.  They evidenced no particular plan, nor any capacity to concoct one, from there.  They posed for pictures.  Or as we say in the biz, evidence.

Thanks to them, I am finding out I harbored more sentimentalism for the Capitol than I thought.  More than I now like to admit.  On those hidden heartstrings, the crowd struck its petulant, dissonant chord, like a ruddy, infantile drunk banging one out on the saloon piano as the sheriff drags him to the door.

I am glad the presidential election is over, and that someone else will be president this year.  I don't particularly look forward to Biden personally, and I am already tired of hearing him speak.  But I look forward to passably competent administration.

Biden will have the bureaucratic machinery of his party, a big hat of Approved Persons from which to draw names for this and that position, the kind only the Dems and GOP now credibly possess.  He won't fill gaps with unqualified relations, or sulk back to maybe-allies to fill gaps.  He won't leave desks in the bowels of critical public apparatus vacant for months on end.  There will be scandals.  The trite, familiar kind.

I do not look forward with unalloyed bliss to this brand of competence, or to all the ends that it will serve.  I've had a look at Joe's record, and it is what it is.  His brand of bipartisanship, on the matters I've studied, bespeaks a deeply entrenched reflex to lick a thumb, stick it above his head, and take off, caring little whence the wind blows, as long as it blows.  He's been around long enough to make mistakes, inevitably.  But some of those worst are the pressing problems of today, our contorted criminal justice system among them.  'Twas a time when "law and order" was _his_ brand, snatched from Republicans who ran not as fast when they all heard the whistle.

In throwing open his party's administrative stable, Biden will welcome its fashions, pettinesses, fealties, corruptions, debts, and patrons to trod into government, as well.  I do not look forward to learning what other hopeful expectations I may have left, just the same, by means of the inevitable disappointments that will bring them to light.  I do not look forward to the encouragement his inauguration will lend those in worn seats of Democratic Party power, who picked Biden the Bland before the rest of us got a choice.  I have not enjoyed reading the ivy-consulting-think-tank-bank bios of so many of his appointees, or how much they've made "speaking" to firms they will now regulate.  I suppose he may rehire some friends of mine, lower down, but I'm not allowed to count that in his favor.

In short, I know American political par, and return to par, from an old and familiar player, is hardly inspiring.  Even if blue has increasingly been my color, when I have to make a choice.  Its main virtue lies in a greater capacity to be safely ignored most of the time.  Such a restoration, from bad to bluster back to bad again, might represent progress, but only if you draw the timeline very short.  Only if you assume the bad we had before had nothing to do with the chaos that temporarily interrupted it, in shocking defiance of history and the obvious.

I fear, most of all, that the party of the victors will take the vanquishing of Trump, Notorious Personality, as psychoactive substitute for victory over all the many meaningful conditions that contributed to his rise.  That they will personalize politics, as they tend to do whenever it suits them, and conclude that slaying the demagogue means banishing all the grievances he so ably channeled, and so completely failed to address, from political relevance.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Not all the factors were racist, fascist, or crazy.  Conflating them denies earnest people recognition at a basic level, and pisses good, pragmatic people off.  This is the slop in our politics that lashes back and binds our gears.

There is no Single Unified Theory of Trump Support.  Even among those grazing in a daze about the chambers of Congress this week, one would doubtless find wide variation, both in what Trump seems to them to be and why they support it, if indeed they all do.  But among Trump's supporters---in their millions---there are those who desperately sought, and rapturously celebrated, a politician on the national stage finally willing to name and declaim just how much intolerable shit the disposable heroes of American labor have had to take for the last fifty years.

The folks were relieved---some event felt delivered---to find a voice expressing their harsh truth in appropriately coarse ways.  Others, of course, were happy to see that rage lashed by chance to a vehicle towing their preferences, social, financial, or both.  But populism in a party does not dissolve populism away.

There are whole families in this country, once self-sufficient and proud, now cast out of every empowered vision of progress.  They cannot reach even the first rungs of the ladder out of the mud.  Having slid down the great slime slope in the back alley of our economy, in this generation or by accident of birth, they find themselves at the bottom of the great economic pit of our society.  There they wander, until one of the flock of carrion industries circling in lofty skies overhead---finance, food, medical, housing, justice, education---bothers to pick the last fiscal and political gristle from their bones.  All to the tune of "allocative efficiencies" or other nebulous principles, popular at great heights.

Temp and contract labor.  Evaporated pensions and savings.  Medical bills and opioid addiction.  Degenerate foodstuff.  Payday loans.  Title debt.  Lotteries, gambling, and rampant gamification.  Contract sales and "innovative" mortgages.  Student loans at predatory institutions.  The latest crypto scam.  And no mercy, or justice, after the fact.  It recalls nothing so well as a B remake of our country's vicious dejections of former slaves after Reconstruction and former soldiers after World War I, as the economy of rural and small-town America lay the cornerstones of prosperity and security on different ground.  Now it rebuilds again, without the need of the local 8-to-5 working man, "white" though he may be, veteran though he may be.  These grievances are popular, because they are populous.

But for all this, I can remain mutely optimistic, on tentative balance.  Because there is a chance, a fleeting chance, that we might have a government that does things again.  As terrifying as the notion of Total Victory, the domination by one part of the whole system, may be, no matter which party has manage to achieve it, or for how long, the excuse of obstruction is gone.  Deliver or die.  Politically, I mean, recent events notwithstanding.

We all know the issues.  Healthcare.  Immigration.  Tax reform.  Drug policy.  Electoral engineering.  Law enforcement.  Education.  Reading any bill Congress manages on these issues will be impossible.  Snippets picked out by the better press and Wikipedia will disappoint us.  But any possible return to reelection by legislative record, rather than reelection by partisan fight card, is hopeful.

Would that they all got kicked off of Twitter, stopped pandering, and starting giving us laws.
