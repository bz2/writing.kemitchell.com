A few snippets, all worthwhile:

<blockquote>
<p markdown="1">And therefore, if the established powers are sensitive and well-informed, if they are visibly trying to meet popular feeling, and actually removing some of the causes of dissatisfaction, no matter how slowly they proceed, provided they are seen to be proceeding, they have little to fear.  It take stupendous and persistent blundering, plus almost infinite tactlessness, to start a revolution from below.  Palace revolutions, interdepartmental revolutions, are a different matter.  So, too, is demagogy.  That stops at relieving the tension by expressing the feeling.  But the statesman knows that such relief is temporary, and if indulged too often, unsanitary.  He, therefore, sees to it that he arouses no feeling which he cannot sluice into a program that deals with the facts to which the feelings refer.</p>

<p markdown="1">They articulate their suffering.  The suffering which has been in this country so long denied.  That's Malcolm's [[Malcolm X's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X)] great authority over any of his audiences.  He corroborates their reality.  He tells them that they really exist, you know?</p>

<p markdown="1">I know your pain.  I know your hurt. ... We love you.  You're very special.  You've seen what happens.  You see the way _others_ are treated that are so bad and so evil.  I know how you feel, but go home, and go home in peace.</p>
<!--  We had an election that was stolen from us.  It was a <em>landslide</em> election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side.  But you have to go home now.  We have to have peace.  We have to respect our great people in law and order.  We don't want anybody hurt.--> <!--<p markdown="1">It's a very tough period of time.  There's never been a time like this, where such a thing happened, where they could take it away, from all of us, from me, from you, from our country.  This was a fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of these people.  We have to have peace.  So go home.</p>-->

And lest we forget there is poetry in a dictionary, bookends:

<blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt>demagogue, n.</dt>
  <dd>1. In ancient times, a leader of the people; a popular leader or orator who espoused the cause of the people against any other party in the state.</dd>
  <dd>2. In bad sense: A leader of a popular faction, or of the mob; a political agitator who appeals to the passions and prejudices of the mob in order to obtain power or further his own interests; an unprincipled or factious popular orator.</dd>

That today's political events _bother_ me comes as an unwelcome and humbling surprise.  These events are highly symbolic.  They are dramatic.  They are photogenic.  They are immediate and intuitive, without apparent subtlety.  In short, they're anger-and-scandal media schlock of the highest grade, and the lowest order.  Fodder for newsmen, and the low part of each of us that wolfs down what they throw us.  Dross, or trivia, for historians.

I suspect these events will matter little or at all, beyond our shared recollection, in a month or two.  I see nothing of material national importance that has suffered damage.  Apart from the lives lost, which will surely bring a great deal of true pain for those personally connected, there is little to mourn as a matter public affairs, rather than private ones.

Those roaming the floors of our legislature unwelcome seemed as surprised as anyone they had made it there.  They evidenced no particular independent plan, nor any capacity to concoct one.  They were not of a mind even on dress code: some sported camouflage, others eye-watering red, white, and blue.  Like a hundred family reunions on their way to Disney, with the odd, moody teenager in black or olive drab phase tossed in, who have just learned their tour bus isn't coming.

The blow fell instead on our perceptions, not our facts.  It defiled any feelings of sanctity we may have left for the federal government, or at least its symbolic seat, where the blessed work of democracy is at least supposed to get done.  There were people in chambers of House and Senate today who did not belong there, were not invited, and showed themselves in by force---laughably little force---and a lot of formulaic ballyhoo.  Because they had been pointed that way.

Thanks to them, I am learning I harbored more such symbolic affiliation with the place than I let on.  More than I would like to admit.  On those latent beatific notions, on those sentimental weakness, today's mob strummed out its haphazard, petulant, dissonant chord, saying nothing discernible.

I am glad that the presidential election is over, and that Biden will take office this year.  I look forward more to passably competent administration, if not to Biden himself.  He'll have the bureaucratic machinery of his party, the big hat of Approved Persons from which to draw names for this and that, which only our major parties credibly possess.  He will not have to fill gaps with unqualified kin, sulk back to uneasy allies, or leave gaping holes in the business of the executive to gape.

I do not look forward with unalloyed bliss to the ends that return to unremarkable competence will serve.  I do not look forward to the encouragement his inauguration will lend those in old seats of power within the Democratic Party, the ones who elevated Biden the Bland before the rest of us got a choice.  I do not look forward to reading how many appointees are millionaires, or how they got that way at big-money consulting firms, conglomerates, think tanks, and banks, or talking at them.

I am not fond of Scranton Joe's record, on matters of policy or matters of party.  His brand of bipartisanship, on the matters I've studied, bespeak a deeply entrenched reflect to lick his thumb, stick it to the wind, and bother little whence it blows.  I expect he will summon not just his party's administrative stable, but its interests, pettinesses, fealties, corruptions, and debts, as well.  I do not look forward to learning what other hopeful expectations I've managed to harbor for him, by means of the inevitable disappointments that reveal them.  As they did for Obama, not so long ago.

In short, I know American political par, and I'm not awaiting return to it with any enthusiasm.  From bad to ineffectual bluster to bad again might represent progress, but only if you draw the timeline short.  I would rather Joe take the oath, get to the job, and set firm precedent abolishing inauguration ceremonies forevermore.  I certainly don't want more ear-grating delusions of national "mandate", like some kind of celestial bonus over and above election, which seem to immediately invade the mind and escape the lips of every vain pol benighted by Electoral College.

I fear, most of all, that the party of victors will allow the vanquishing of Trump, Notorious Personality, to wash over them as a kind of surrogate for actual policy success in addressing the conditions that produced him.  That they will personalize Trump, as they always do, and conclude that slaying a demagogue means banishing all grievances he so ably channeled, and so completely failed to address, for the next political generation.  Probably, they will, priming another backlash.

There is no unitary Theory of Support for Trump.  Even among those grazing in a daze about Congress today, one would doubtless find wide variation, both in what Trump seems to them and why they support him, if indeed they do.  But among Trump's supporters---in their millions---there are those who desperately sought, and rapturously celebrated, a politician on the national stage finally willing to articulate just how much intolerable shit those disposable heroes of labor left behind in the past five decades have had to take, and how unapologetically intolerable it was.

There are whole generations in this country, once self-sufficient, now cast out of every prevailing theory of economic progress.  Down at the bottom, they can't reach even the first rung of the ladder.  They circle in the bottom of the great economic pit, at the end of the great downward slope at the back end of America, captive prey for myriad industries---food, financial, medical, &c.---willing to find a cost-effective way to separate their last fiscal flesh from the gristle.  Unemployment and unorganized labor.  Medical bills and opioid addiction.  Cheap, fattening, sugar-leaden food.  Payday loans.  Rent-to-own.  Gambling and lotteries.  The latest crypto scam.

I remain mutely and self-defensively optimistic, on tentative balance, because there is a chance, a fleeting chance, that we might have government that proceeds again.  We all know the issues.  Healthcare.  Immigration.  Tax reform.  Electoral engineering.  Education.  Reading any bill Congress manages on these issues will be impossible.  Excerpts picked out by the better press and Wikipedia will disappoint us.  But any possible return to reelection by legislative record, rather than reelection by rhetoric, is hopeful.  We've heard the "mob's" cry, and it was much the same as from reasonable, workaday people.  It would be nice to hear less about it, and see more done.
