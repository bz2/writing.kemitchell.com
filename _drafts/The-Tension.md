Read, muddle, and stir:

<p markdown="1">And therefore, if the established powers are sensitive and well-informed, if they are visibly trying to meet popular feeling, and actually removing some of the causes of dissatisfaction, no matter how slowly they proceed, provided they are seen to be proceeding, they have little to fear.  It take stupendous and persistent blundering, plus almost infinite tactlessness, to start a revolution from below.  Palace revolutions, interdepartmental revolutions, are a different matter.  So, too, is demagogy.  That stops at relieving the tension by expressing the feeling.  But the statesman knows that such relief is temporary, and if indulged too often, unsanitary.  He, therefore, sees to it that he arouses no feeling which he cannot sluice into a program that deals with the facts to which the feelings refer.</p>

Bookends.

That yesterday's political events _bother_ me comes as an unwelcome and humbling surprise.  These events were symbolic.  They were dramatic.  They were photogenic.  They were shallow and intuitive.  In short, they were media schlock of the first order.  Fodder for the news, dross, or trivia, for the histories.

I suspect these events will matter little or at all, beyond our shared recollection, in a month or two.  I see nothing of material national importance that has suffered real damage.  Apart from the lives lost, which will surely bring a great deal of true pain for those personally connected, there is little to mourn as a matter public affairs, distinct from private ones.

<!--Those roaming the floors of our legislature unwelcome seemed as surprised as anyone that they had made it there.  They evidenced no particular plan, nor any capacity to concoct one.  They were not of a mind even on dress code: some sported camouflage, others tactical black, others eye-watering red, white, and blue.  Like a hundred family reunions on their way to Disney, with the odd, moody teenager in a phase tossed in, who have just learned their tour bus isn't coming.-->

The blow fell instead on our perceptions.  It defiled any feelings of sanctity we may have for the federal government, or at least its symbolic seat, where the blessed work of democracy is supposed to get done.  There were people in chambers of Congress yesterday who did not belong there, were not invited, and showed themselves in by force---laughably little force, sanctity considered---and a lot of backwash brouhaha.

Because they had been pointed that way.  Having made it so far, they seemed as surprised as anyone they hadn't been stopped.  They evidenced no particular plan, nor any capacity to concoct one.  They posed for pictures.

Thanks to them, I am learning I harbored more symbolic affinity with the Capitol than I let on.  More than I would like to admit.  On those latent sentimentalities, the mob struck its haphazard, petulant, dissonant chord, like an infantilized drunk ejected from a bar, banging a few keys on the lounge piano before the bouncer drags him out.

I am glad the presidential election is over, and that someone else will take office this year.  I look forward to passably competent administration, if not to Biden himself.  He'll have the bureaucratic machinery of his party, the big hat of Approved Persons from which to draw names for this and that, which only the major parties credibly possess.  He won't fill gaps with unqualified relations, or sulk back to a party that dislikes him to fill gaps.  He won't leave desks in the bowels of the public apparatus vacant for months on end.

I do not look forward with unalloyed bliss to the ends restored competence will serve.  I've had a look at Joe's record, and it is what it is.  His brand of bipartisanship, on the matters I've studied, bespeaks a deeply entrenched reflex to lick a thumb, stick it to the wind, and care little whence it blows, as long as it blows.  He's been around long enough to make mistakes, inevitably.  But some of those worst are the pressing problems of today, our contorted criminal justice system among them.  'Twas a time when "law and order" was his opportunity, snapped from the jaws of Republicans who failed to move as fast.

In throwing open his party's administrative stable, Biden will welcome its fashions, pettinesses, fealties, corruptions, and debts back into government, as well.  I do not look forward to learning what other hopeful expectations I may have left for him, by means of the inevitable disappointments that will bring them to light.  I do not look forward to the encouragement his inauguration will lend those in worn seats of Democratic Party power, who picked Biden the Bland before the rest of us got a choice.  I have not enjoyed reading the ivy-consulting-think-tank-bank bios of so many of his appointees, or how much they've made "speaking" to firms they will now regulate.

In short, I know American political par, and I am hardly inspired.  From bad to bluster to bad again might represent progress, but only if you draw the timeline very short.  Only if you assume the bad before had nothing to do with the bluster that interrupted.

I fear, most of all, that the party of the victors will allow the vanquishing of Trump, Notorious Personality, to substitute for victory over the conditions that gave rise to him.  That they will personalize politics, as they tend to do whenever they can, and conclude that slaying the demagogue means banishing all grievances he so ably channeled, and so completely failed to address, from political relevance.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  This is where backlash comes from.

There is no Single Unified Theory of Trump Support.  Even among those grazing in a daze about Congress yesterday, one would doubtless find wide variation, both in what Trump seems to them to be and why they support it, if indeed they do.  But among Trump's supporters---in their millions---there are those who desperately sought, and rapturously celebrated, a politician on the national stage finally willing to articulate just how much intolerable shit the disposable heroes of American defense and labor left behind in the past five decades have had to take.

There are whole families in this country, once self-sufficient, now cast out of every empowered vision of progress.  Down at the bottom, they cannot reach even the first rungs of the ladder.  They mull about the bottom of the great economic pit, having slid off the end of the steep, slippery slope at the back end of America.  They are picked off, one by one, by a flock of benighted industries circling overhead---food, financial, medical, housing---who bother to pick the last fiscal and political gristle from their bones.  Temp and contract labor.  Medical bills and opioid addiction.  Cheap, obesity- and diabetes-inducing food.  Payday loans.  Title debt.  Rent-to-own.  Gambling and lotteries.  Contract sales.  Student debt.  The latest crypto scam.  It recalls nothing so well as our companies reprehensible, acrid policy toward former slaves of the Reconstruction era, as the economy of the South lay its cornerstones elsewhere.

But for all this, I remain mutely and self-defensively optimistic, on tentative balance.  Because there is a chance, a fleeting chance, that we might have a government that does things again.

We all know the issues.  Healthcare.  Immigration.  Tax reform.  Drug policy.  Electoral engineering.  Law enforcement.  Education.  Reading any bill Congress manages on these issues will be impossible.  Excerpts picked out by the better press and Wikipedia will disappoint us.  But any possible return to reelection by legislative record, rather than reelection by rhetoric, is hopeful.

We've heard the "mob's" cry, and it was much the same as from reasonable, workaday people.  It would be nice to hear less about it, and see more done.
