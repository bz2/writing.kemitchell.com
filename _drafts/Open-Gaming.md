title: Open Gaming Deja Vu
---

At the dawn of the twentieth century, the role playing game industry was deep in the throes of open source fever.  [Wizards of the Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizards_of_the_Coast), planned to extract and release the "operating system" of its prize property, [Dungeons & Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons), as [d20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D20_System), as an adaptable base for others to create on top of.

[This interview with Ryan Dancey](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/article.asp?x=dnd/md/md20020228e), then Wizards' VP for RPGs and prime mover behind the nascent Open Gaming Foundation.

> In fact, we believe that there may be a secondary market force we jokingly call "The Skaff Effect," after our own [game designer] Skaff Elias.  Skaff is one of the smartest guys in the company, and after looking at lots of trends and thinking about our business over a long period of time, he enunciated his theory thusly:
>
> "All marketing and sales activity in a hobby gaming genre eventually contributes to the overall success of the market share leader in that genre."

> We make more revenue and more profit from our core rulebooks than any other part of our product lines.  In a sense, every other RPG product we sell other than the core rulebooks is a giant, self-financing marketing program to drive sales of those core books.

> The result is that D20 becomes a rosetta stone for making products that will be compatible with Dungeons & Dragons, without requiring us to issue a blanket license for the D&D trademarks.  In other words, we want to use the trademarks of D&D to hold the value of the business, rather than the rules themselves.
>
> We're going to establish "D20" as a recognizable mark, like "VHS" or "DVD".  It will appear on all D&D products.

> However, the _trademarks_ of the D20 System are licensed by a separate document, the D20 System Trademark License.  The terms of that License are substantially more restrictive.

> separate, expensive, and very restrictive license with Wizards of the Coast

noncomeptitive restrictions, e.g. against guides for creating characters, apply experience of characters

>: At some time in the future, after we've gauged the effects of this activity, we may loosen those restrictions.

- primary use case: creating adventures
- campaign settings ok
- genre-specific game ok, but handbook is fantasy-themed
- book of creatures ok
- book of spells or magic items ok
- D&D adventure: not ok
- > Patents are great.  They can lock a game mechanic away behind a legal wall very effectively.  Trademarks are great.  They can stop a lot of commercial products dead by refusing to allow those terms to be used.  Copyrights---eh; not so good.  Copyrights cannot protect an idea---just a particular expression of an idea.
>
> One of my fundamental arguments is that by pursuing the Open Gaming concept, Wizards can establish a clear policy on what it will, and will not allow people to do with its copyrighted materials.  Just that alone should spur a huge surge in independent content creation that will feed in to the D&D network.

- at trade show: will share behind NDA
