title: Efficient Merit Apocalypse

There's little hope human beings will overcome our innate flaws anytime soon.  But as consolation, our common, crippling foibles become ever more predictable over time, thanks to careful study by obsessed experts.  Case in Point: our noted bent to be helpfully specific about what's good for us, and inevitably vague on why we ought to have it.

In computing, the hallmark of this universal affliction has been fairly well beaten to death.  "Meritocracy", as it turns out, is totally true ... for all manner of unhelpful, self-serving, lazy, and otherwise disappointing meanings of "merit".  The rich and famous among hackers bask in the warm glow of a general theory that they come by their wealth and notoriety because they're the bestest.  But there are few better-than-circular arguments for that leap of self-affirming faith.  Few of the famous _don't_ deserve success.  But there are many like them who haven't come out so well.  It helps to be good to get that lucky, but luck isn't exactly what we mean by fairness, and exhibits some troubling biases.

The tech sector is hardly alone in harboring, cultivating, and festering expedient generalities like meritocracy.  For those unfamiliar with similar innovations on the _other_ coast of the country, consider the [efficient-market hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis?wprov=srpw1_0), the once and ever doubtful self-realizing religion of finance.  If you can't see the warps in the mirror of meritocracy, see if you can find it an industry apart.

In wonk terms, the efficient-market hypothesis holds that market prices of assets, like the prices of publicly traded stocks, bonds, and derivatives, reflect all information available to participants in those markets.  When the market is public, like the stock market, that means all public information.  Put another way, if the market is "free" enough, the current market price of an asset reflects the true and proper value of that asset, right here, right now, based on all available information.  It's as good a guess as we're able to get.

Wonks being wonks, there are different forms or meanings of the efficient market hypothesis.  Some focus on the kinds of information rolled up into price.  Others focus on the degree of fundamental truthiness in the prices.  Options range from absolute and fatalistic to suspiciously iffy-wishy-washy.  But in any form, at its core, the efficient market hypothesis lays an erudite economic sheen over the old quip that the value of a thing is what people will pay for it.  Markets set prices, and markets are _right_.  In certain circles, "right" is pronounced "efficient".

Dismayingly enough, if you take the time to think about it, the efficient market hypothesis is rather bad news for would-be bazillionaires.  Efficiency implies that "beating" the market---doing a better job of pricing assets individually than the market does as a whole---isn't reliably possible.  Individual outcomes may vary, as randomness does.  But there's no better oracle of value than the market as a whole.  Not at the fancy hedge fund across the river.  Not between your aching neck and furrowed brows.  You might as well buy a total market index fund, and shop around for the lowest  fees you can find.  If you'd rather be a [noise trader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_trader), brokers will happily take your tolls until you fold.

Hardly an inspiring personal credo:  "Give up.  The market's got this."  But fear not.  In personal terms, for many traders, all such nuanced implications are necessarily and conveniently lost.  Distilled down to an individual level, shaded by self-interest, the message is different.

If you've "won" in the markets, and become rich, you've contributed to the process of market efficiency, of ensuring the Great Financial Machine spits out true and correct value assessments for the benefit of all mankind.  If your gains came at the expense of others, that's well and dandy, too.  You were closer to truth---to "[alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_(finance))"---while they rightfully languished in the herd, chewing "[beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_(finance))" cud and imposing their irrationalities on public finance.  They've learned something.  You've taught them.  If they cannot learn, you've put their money in better hands.

Whether it's efficiency in finance or merit in tech, these hypotheses could not be more helpfully reassuring.  They esteem winners as just, well earned, even prosocial.  They decry losers as unhelpful, flawed, and deserving.  They encapsulate, in pithy phrases, a pleasantly simple, emergent esteem of not just individual plays and outcomes, but the system as a whole.  As a winner, you deserved what you won, full stop.  And the world should be grateful for your winning.  Your privileges aren't merely _fair_, but _noble_.

The awe inspiring psychological _convenience_ of these deductions alone ought to throw some sideways glances at their premises.

Consider the matter of accounting.  When we win, we know by how much.  We can measure it---usually in dollars---with specificity.  Banks, regulators, and tax men can audit our books, and come to the same numeric conclusion of our greatness, for the lines from our actions to our dollars are very clear.

That is nothing like the situation with the _merit_, _efficiency_, or general _deservedness_ of those winnings.  There it's all theory, generality, and rhetoric.  Or, if we're more honest, ideology.  Even if you buy that the theories themselves stand empirically validated---despite vigorous debate among those who actually do empirical validation---the profs haven't studied us for their papers.  They don't publish certificates of individual merit.

Or rather, when they do, there's no reliable, one-to-one correlation to splendid fortune.  In computing, it's almost trite to point out that the Turing, the brightest of stars, got little in the way of transferable gratitude while he lived.  Because in addition to being a genius, a war hero, and a member of no discernible oppressed minority, Turing was gay and admitted to getting laid.
