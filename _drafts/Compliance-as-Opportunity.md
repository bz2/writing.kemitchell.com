New, stronger copyleft licenses often raise corporate compliance alarms.  Companies, especially big companies, will have to update open source policies, training programs, and employee supervision to avoid stepping in the new license.  Big, industry-wide hassle.  Not worth it.

Wait just a minute now.  A loose, distributed movement is steering what thousands of firms say to thousands upon thousands of people?  How is that not a massive opportunity?  What kind of movement passes that up, and lays low?

I strongly suspect most companies considerately dealing with open source approach mass compliance the same way.  Everything under common permissive licenses like Apache 2.0 is A-0K for whatever.  Anything under a weak-copyleft license like LGPL or MPL is good to use, but not to hack.  A few famous projects under strong-copyleft licenses, like Linux, GCC, and GNU coreutils, are also fine, as long as you use just as directed.  Everything else is no-go or an e-mail to Legal.

In outline, this is more or less the [starter policy](https://blueoakcouncil.org/starter-policy) from Blue Oak Council.  Fleshed out, it's more like the [company policy](https://blueoakcouncil.org/company-policy) from Blue Oak Council.

The approach is totally understandable.  It's the 80-20 road to open source.  Maximum value for minimal trouble.  Which is exactly why Blue Oak published those policies, so nonprofits and small firms without open-savvy lawyers can use them.  But that 80-20 approach is woefully incomplete.  It's teaching open source as read-only, not read-write.  It's pitching [Open Source 1.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0#Web_1.0) and, yeah, it's kind of lame.  The 20% people are getting is kind of missing the point.

On the receiving end of this kind of compliance program, as a newbie, you'd never get the message that open source comes from schmucks like you.  You'd never learn that at some companies, kicking a patch back to an LGPL library, or hanging out in the GitHub repo of a GPL project, is everyday stuff, even at proprietary software firms.  You'd never get the message that a lot of the projects you're downloading, drive-by style, would be glad to have you hang around, even if you're not a credentialed computer scientist, even if you're just starting to code.  You're not even really told that copyleft _requires_ sharing alike.  You're just hearing it's a no-go.  Because it's complicated.

There are many reasons open source takers outnumber makers.  We can't entirely blame in-house compliance programs.  But teaching a one-way, take-only version of open source can't be helping.

Neither can the state of copyleft.

Dig around the websites of free software activists, you're bound to run into the idea of "copyleft as excuse".  In some cases, which GPL fans love to report, the _requirement_ to share back under a license has given an in-house developer leverage to get their legal departments to consider and approve contribution back.  They didn't wanna at first.  Or rather, they didn't even want to think about it.  But once they did, they can end up glad they did.  And not just to dodge a license violation.

That doesn't happen when the copyleft license only requires sharing back if you use it some other, unlikely way.  It might also happen in cases where the developer wants to share a patch, but the lawyer finds a little-known exception---like "private changes"---in the text.

Speaking of license violations, and to the credit of the Free Software Foundation and friends, I get the impression the kind of training these groups often require offending companies to provide their people, as part of settling out license violations, would do a lot better job of emphasizing read-write than the corporate norm.  The set and setting could surely be better.  A mandatory meeting is a mandatory meeting.  But the sitters these organizations are going to send wouldn't be the type to miss something so fundamental.

Maybe the firm ticks the box, does the training, and immediately bans all free or open source forevermore.  Once bitten and all that.  But maybe half the folks in the trainings are working somewhere else six months later, and take their open minds to friendlier environs.

Are there quality, ready-made, copyleft-friendly training materials out there?  Is anyone using them?  If not, why the devil haven't movement seized that opportunity to spread the gospel?
