One of the great downsides of attending the University of Texas School of Law was having [Lino Graglia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lino_Graglia) for Constitutional Law.  The wider world knows Lino for resisting the integration of school busing, and for missing a chance at the Fifth Circuit bench largely on that account.  Law students know him best for teaching poorly, for extemporizing random walks through his own idiosyncratic opinions, and for shooting occasionally [racist and discriminatory remarks](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/16/us/texas-law-professor-prompts-a-furor-over-race-comments.html) from the hip, sometimes in class.

One of the great upsides of having a Lino Graglia in your first year of law school is that it forces awareness that, as in [high school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lies_My_Teacher_Told_Me), law school will throw a fair amount of propaganda your way.  The material, and more importantly the framing and foregone conclusions of the material, aren't necessarily for your benefit, as a student, or for the benefit of your clients, as a lawyer-to-be.  Other interests are at work, which have identified lawyers as influential and law school as a choke point through which they must pass, in formative years.

Thus, like the citizens of the crumbling Soviet Union who knew there was "no pravda [truth] in Pravda [the [newspaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravda)]" while their American peers [trusted Walter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cronkite), things weren't great, but a healthy skepticism prevailed.  When the professor assigns a casebook that nobody else uses, written by an fellow ideological traveler, filled with typos and formatting errors, at a premium price, for lack of widespread demand, it's hard to ignore what's going on.

Other signs more overt.  You know [Antonin Scalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonin_Scalia)'s zinger-leader, trash-talk dissents were designed to sway law students, because he said so.  It took not great leap of imagination to see the same motive behind [Ginsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Bader_Ginsburg), [Kozinski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kozinski), or [Posner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Posner), writing with their posses or in dissent.
