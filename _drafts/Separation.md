The short path to political stardom isn't hard to spot in history.  Offer the public a simple, intuitive theory---an ideology---that promises quick solutions to painful, complex problems.  Meanwhile, drum up suspicion, even hatred, of a scapegoat.  You will need a scapegoat when your theory inevitably fails, as it predictably will if you gain enough power to try and use it.

On the odd chance you gain a lot of power, try to die near your peak, before the inevitable whiplash that top-down dictate brings.  Steer those you love well clear of politics.  Pave paths for them to foreign shores, wealth, and obscurity well before you're gone.  When the equal and opposite political reaction arrives, they must be politically irrelevant.

We define "ideology", like "religion", in terms of deep belief in the absence of compelling evidence.  We take our ideologies and religions into our worldly experiences, not out of them.  Once we do believe, all manner of evidence seems to appear, when only we look for it.  That evidence comes to seem compelling, but only to those already convinced.

Also like religions, the strongest ideologies spread quickly and denounce competition.  They are mutually exclusive, seek out combat, and revel in conquest.  But strangely enough, we have come to learn, from experience, rather than theory, that freedom of religion, not compulsion to religion or suppression of religion, affords the most peace.

Under freedom of religion, millions of citizens are permitted, even tacitly encouraged, to hold, spread, and act out utterly incompatible beliefs.  But this is not any great civic tournament of religions.  There is no prize.  In tandem with the freedom of religion comes the separation of church of state.  Our state has awesome powers.  But establishing, preferring, or discriminating against any religion aren't among them.  When the state is strong, religions needn't fear it.  When the state is weak, religions needn't bloody each other in pursuit of it.

While not specifically stated, the United States arguably secures freedom of ideology to its citizens, if only by implication of other civil rights.  In trying times, we've had reason to strongly consider making that freedom more explicit.  During the world wars, we suppressed fascism, or those rumored to subscribe to fascism, whether they broke any laws or not.  Before and after, we suppressed communism, or those rumored to subscribe to communism, likewise on the basis of belief.
