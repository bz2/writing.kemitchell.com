EBMUD's [fees for hydrant meters](https://www.ebmud.com/customers/start-or-stop-service/hydrant-meters/) currently stand at:

<table>
  <tr><th>Deposit</th><td>$900</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Account Establishment Fee</th><td>$123</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Service Fee</th><td>$468.38</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Flow Charges</th><td>$5.98 per hundred cubic feet (or roughly $0.008 per gallon, or $0.002 per liter)</td></tr>
</table>

So, before any flow charges:

- Operating a hydrant meter for one year costs $900.00 + $123.00 + ($468.38 &times; 12 &div; 2) = $3,833.28.

- Operating a hydrant meter for six months costs $900.00 + $123.00 + ($468.38 &times; 6 &div; 2) = $2,428.14.

In each case, $900 is refundable on return of undamaged equipment.

The cost of bottled water off the shelf at discount grocery stores in Oakland hovers around $1 per gallon.  That's roughly 125 times the cost from EBMUD.  So a meter makes sense when you pump more gallons than you spend dollars on hydrant meter fees.  Could we pump 4,000 gallons of drinking water for Oakland homeless camps in a year?  Oh God yes!

But it's only worth talking about the cost of bottled water because so many homeless people are forced to pay it so often.  The real comparison is to other, bulk sources of water.

The cost of potable water from a permanent EBMUD connection depends on volume, elevation, and type of account.  Roughly speaking, we can call it the same as the cost through a hydrant meter: a little shy of $6 per hundred cubic feet.  So the real question is whether the ability to get water from a hydrant outweighs warrants the cost of a hydrant meter, rather than the cost of transporting water form the permanent connection to the camp.

Transporting water means containers.  The most cost-effective containers I've found are five- and six-gallon HDPE jerrycans.  These run $15 at the cheapest up to $25 for really good ones.  They're reusablel
