## Substack takes a broader license to your stuff than you might expect.

> However, please note that you agree to grant us a **limited** license to your content in order to enable us to operate Substack.  **This license allows us to promote your content and help you succeed on Substack.**

I would change "agree to grant" to just "grant" here.

> You agree that this limited license includes a worldwide, nonexclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, transferable right (a) to market your newsletters and to permit others to use, access, and download your newsletters through Substack, and (b) to use your tradename(s), trademark(s), and logo(s) in connection with the distribution and marketing of newsletters. ...

## This is an exclusive relationship.

> You may not circumvent your payment obligations to us by soliciting payment from a Reader outside of Substack or by using any alternative method to collect subscription payments.  This includes receiving payments for your newsletter through links to Paypal or a separate Patreon page.

## You're on your own for some payment management stuff.

> You may delete one or more of your newsletters from Substack at your discretion. **However, please note that if you delete or stop publishing a newsletter before the end of a paid subscription term of a Reader, any and all obligations --- including any refund obligations for the remaining portion of the subscription term --- are solely your responsibility.**  We are under no obligation to issue any refunds to you or your Readers and we are entitled to keep any and all portions of any Revenue Share you have paid Substack.

## Content rules are typical for the web, not publishing.

## They can boot you at any time.
