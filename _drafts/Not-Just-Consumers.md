We heard that concern for the customer over and over in our interviews with Amazon executives.

> Customer trust in a company like Amazon ... it's sort of foundational.

> Customer obsession is the first leadership principle and it's not a corporate slogan.

> We try to stay really focused on customers.

> Very focused on delivering results for our customers.

> Providing a great customer experience that customers want.

> Delivering that ... that customer delight.

This commitment to the customer and to keeping prices low had another benefit.  It helped them avoid running afoul of regulators who enforce the nation's antitrust laws.

> It's important to understand, sort of, that there's two fundamental philosophies of antitrust or antimonopoly law.  There's the traditional philosophy in which you want to break up all potential concentrations of power that you can, but for the last thirty years, there's been this change in how we do antitrust.  And this is the idea that the only purpose of antitrust should be to drive prices lower, to serve the interest of the consumer.

Lynn had been urging regulators to take a more traditional approach and examine whether the company was gaining market power in exploitative ways: stifling fair competition, but keeping prices low for consumers.

> We live in a society of consumers, though.  And seemingly there is some benefit to all of us when prices are low.  So what's wrong with that view of things?

> It's obviously good for people to ... for all people we can drive down prices.  If we have lower-priced drugs.  If we have books that anybody could buy.  That's a good thing.  It's a good thing for society.  And it's a good thing for us as consumers.  But we're not only consumers.  We're also citizens.  We're also producers.  We're also people who think and who make things and who grow things.  And we want to have access to open markets.
