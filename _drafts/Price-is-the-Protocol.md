You want to start, grow, or keep up some software.  You've admitted to yourself you need money to do it.  Or maybe you just deserve it.  Either way, you need to send that message to those who'd benefit from your work.  You need them to see it, to understand it, to take it seriously, to act.  Achieving all that your own way is hard.  Fortunately, there's a widely understood, reliable, thoroughly "open" protocol you can use to send your message.  That protocol is price.

To get money:

1.  Put a price on something.

2.  Tell everyone you can about it.

3.  Tell everyone how to pay you for it.

4.  When they pay, deliver what you promised.

5.  If they don't pay, improve what you're selling, lower your price, or both.

6.  If you can't sell enough times for enough money, sell something else.

The price protocol is so strong that people sometimes put prices on things with little or no value and still get paid.  And not just by friends, family, or rando Internet lulz hounds and speculators.  By businesses.  With accountants.  And managers.  And budgets.  Because, for whatever reason, someone with pull wants to pay, even if what's delivered doesn't make a good deal.  And, crucially, because the receiving end is _payable_.

If you set no price---for licenses, access, time, endorsement, whatever---you aren't practically payable.  In the eyes of the price system, plus company policies, accounting, tax, and everything else built atop that system, you don't exist.  Figuring out how to pay you, and how much, can and often will cost more than the amount you are paid.  Time is money.  Yours and theirs.

Without a price, receiving payment is exceptional.  With a price, receiving payment is the rule.  Companies _can_ pay amounts that aren't prices, but they rarely do.  When they do, they prefer to write relatively large checks to relatively large, well known, noncontroversial charities.  Which they take off their taxes.  If it's not a price and not a deductible donation, it's often totally unclear how to manage it.  Can they deduct the amount?  Can they expense it?  Can they even process the payment?  How will the auditors tell this one-way "leak" of funds from an accounting bodge?  From a bribe?

The price system isn't the only system.  There are others.  Some also route money around.  But they are all much smaller than the price system.  And often far more competitive.

Consider donations and their high roller cousins, grants.  The words evoke money bestowed on charities, with nothing beyond recognition delivered in return.  Donations to religious groups.  Donations to the Red Cross.  Grants for basic research.  Grants to lift up the downtrodden.

Face facts.  When people have money to give away, to do good or to feel good, there are way better options than you and your software.  Early childhood education.  Addiction treatment.  Food banks.  Organizations for human rights.  Coalitions for peace.  Impoverished nations far far away.  Homeless people down the street from you.  Problems computers cannot solve.  Problems of people who don't have computers.

Even to advance the cause of software, there are many more attractive vessels for cash---ACM, IEEE, the nearest computer science department.  These are easier to find, easier to fund, and, frankly, easier to feel good about funding.  Especially if your work is clearly of use to folks who aren't objects of charity.  Especially if your work is used in business.  Nobody donates to business, or likes to admit when they do.

When we give money for a high and noble cause, that's clearly charity.  When the cause is the person receiving the cash, it depends on the person.  If that person is poor, downtrodden, injured by fate, that's charity, too.  When sprinkling money on them as a group wouldn't get charity, sprinkling money on them individually isn't charity, either.  It's a gift.

It's as strange for Internet strangers to gift competent programmers money as it is for you to gift software to startups, professionals, and Fortune 500 companies.  Taking money out of these pictures doesn't make them charitable.  The food at at the Googleplex cafeteria may be free, but Google is not a soup kitchen.  The Red Cross merch store will sell you [a $600 chair](https://www.redcross.org/store/lg-500-plastic-lifeguard-chair/760046.html), but the Red Cross isn't IKEA.

Even if your work _weren't_ an awkward mismatch for charity, your odds of great success competing for donations remain dire.  Bringing in donations, and especially grants, takes serious work.

One of the first thing successful charities do is hire someone to raise money full- or part-time.  Moreover, that work is seriously competitive.  Mailboxes are flooded with charity solicitations.  Call centers barrage thousands of people per day.  Special offices woo the ultra-wealthy, hustling as the tax year closes, angling for deathbed bequests.  Vendors hock donation-specific knock-offs of Salesforce, and charities buy them.  Consultants rumored to possess mass-appeal mojo, or schooled in the dark arts of grantwriting esoterica, command princely sums.  Marketing agencies charge handsome rates to guard and develop trusted brands.  Governments attempt to referee the frenzy, requiring charities to register in many states where they trawl for cash.

The last time I moved house, my ISP failed botched closure of my account.  Their system kept accruing charges, which they bundled as a debt and sold to a collector.  The collector found my new address, and mailed me a few months after I moved in.  The fundraisers at my alma mater beat them by several weeks.  I have no idea how they found the address.

The business of hustling donations, in short, is a business.  Its protocol is price.

There is nothing shallow, callous, or antisocial about price.
