Internet exceptionalism goes both ways.

Thanks in part to a rousing 1990-era libertarian hero-origin story, the Internet industry has long enjoyed special status, and even special laws.  Such favor coddled, but did not require, benign indifference to what others have to say online.  But as Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, and others show this week, those protections were never requirements.  Private firms can and do withhold their online services, and neither political affiliation nor political relevance confer special protection.  Those feeling the stick now frantically rummage for different weapons, from dusty antitrust laws to Section 230 amendments, to avenge their riven expectations.  They bought the Valley's line, and now they want a refund.

But why aren't they slinging similar stones at other media services?  From the anarchist print collective down the street to NPR, MSNBC, the New York Times, Comcast, and TimeWarner, there are plenty of places their views, content, and services aren't welcome.  But as far as I can tell, we aren't hearing similar clamor for common-carrier requirements and injunctions to break those firms up, as well.  Even though they're in the same business of distributing content, playing favorites, and selling ads.  Even though they've been combining, acquiring, growing enormous, and throwing political weight around for decades.  On that last, frankly, they show Big Tech up for a bunch of amateurs.  As do their Republican-aligned counterpart-competitors.

Simple: We've been through it with them already.  Nobody expects other mass media to accept all views or strike a balance, so we cannot be shocked or disappointed when they don't.  No world views came crashing down when Bill O'Reilly talked over guests, cut mics, or banished newsworthy personalities.  Nobody called to break up MSNBC when they started running Maddow.

The era of anodyne mass-market centrism is long gone in print, radio, television, and film.  The [Fairness Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCC_fairness_doctrine) is dead.  So are the practical limitations---each outlet needs its own chunk of broadcast spectrum---that capped how many outlets there could be.  Platforms that once chose their stories, reporters, letters to editor, hosts, and guests under the guise of "objectivity"---discrimination against anything beyond a narrowly defined band of moderation, rather than against a particular party---now hew to one party line or the other, and openly.  We've seen massive shifts of just that kind in the last ten years, with cable news and even the original Big Three.  When it was just them, they were "objective".  Once Fox came around, they were boring.  Now, at some basic level, they all look and sound like Fox.

Oddly enough, the facts on Big Tech this week aren't in broad dispute.  Twitter, Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon Web Services, and likely more companies are booting extreme right-wing voices, and services catering to them, from their platforms.  They cite threats of violence and instrumentality in the storming of the Capitol last week.  We disagree on why they are doing these things, not on what they are doing.

From the red point of view, it's rank partisan discrimination.  Twitter, Facebook, and Silicon Valley are blue.  We are red.  When they do us ill, it's because we're red.  Tech is one big MSNBC, and they're cutting off our mic, running sucker-punch crawls, and favoring their pick for president.

From the blue point of view, it's about extremism and illegality, not politics.  Parler wasn't Republican so much as Trumpist, and this week Trumpism means threatening to lynch elected officials and coordinating an assault on the election.  Tech is one big university campus, and while debate continues, terrorist groups aren't welcome.

From the money-is-green point of view, it's all business.  Having multifunctional teams on call to deal with whatever Trump or his people say next, whenever they say it, is a big, expensive, disruptive distraction.  It injects politics right into the heart of day-to-day operations, straight up to the executive level.  That's just before the fact.  After the fact, hosting this content earns us a bunch of burdensome law enforcement requests, lawsuits, and user complaints, especially after last week.  Our marketing people can't keep up with all the press linking us to controversy.  It's clear these people aren't worth dealing with.  They're making our ad buyers nervous.  Cut them off.

Perhaps the majority of Americans might like online platforms that welcome partisan voices, from right to left, but exclude extremists from the fringe of each side.  Perhaps advertisers would prefer to buy ads on such sites, too.  But if experience of other media is any indication, that is not what market forces have led firms to deliver.  It's a lot easier to say how the Web is different than why those differences matter in this respect.  The story we used to tell ourselves to bridge that deductive gap---that the Internet is inherently "free", as in "rule-free"---reads like old sales brochures now.
