[Project clients](https://availability.kemitchell.com/#project), who pay me by the quarter-hour, often ask me to estimate fees on specific jobs.  Due to the nature of the work that I take, especially with new clients or counterparties, with whom I've yet to find a working rhythm, I often can't do better than explain my uncertainty and guess at high and low figures.  I'm not interested in making financial bets to cover estimate overruns outside my control.  My clients aren't interested in paying estimates high enough to cover the worst-case scenarios I see.  But after explaining the reasons of that uncertainty, I'm often able to avoid anxiety about my bill by agreeing to a billing "breakpoint".  A billing breakpoint works both to reduce financial risk and to build trust.

In coder talk, "breakpoints" are a feature of tools used to "debug" computer programs.  Debuggers run programs, like computers usually do, but one step at a time, showing the computer's internal work as it goes.  This enables programmers to watch their programs work, and to pause them working at any particular point.  Programmers tell debuggers to pause and report at specific points in programs by "setting breakpoints" there.  Programmers can also tell debuggers to pause is particular conditions are met, such as a value meeting or exceeding a numeric threshold.

By analogy, a billing breakpoint is a particular point at which I stop work and e-mail the client a report of progress made and time spent.  Most commonly, these breakpoints take the form of a dollar value, like $2,000: when I've spent $2,00 0 worth of time, I stop and check in with the client.

Breakpoints like this attack most new clients' darkest fear: that they will sign my engagement letter, hear from me not at all, and sometime later receive a monstrous bill.  If I blow through a breakpoint and don't check in, any overage is on me.  The client did not authorized it.

Breakpoints also help to develop a sense of connection between dollars of fees and progress made.  They give the client an early, relatively safe moment to assess whether they're getting their money's worth.
