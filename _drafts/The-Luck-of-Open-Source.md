Part of the reason _War and Peace_ is so long is that it's really two works in one: first a long, epic novel of tsarist Russia under Napoleonic invasion, then a forceful essay on what that novel _means_.  What the novel shows, according to Tolstoy, is the folly of understanding human history as a drawing room play of a few idiosyncratic ["Great Men"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory), flanked by casts of thousands or millions of ordinary people in background-filling roles.  Personalizing history at a social scale we can understand is merely a memorable way to make and tell approachable stories.  Yet the true arc of human experience traces the many aggregated desires, choices, and struggles of great masses of individuals, families, and sundry often ephemeral associations---Great or not---both subject to and part of great changes beyond the power or comprehension of any one of them, or any author.

So many of us know and share the Great Men drama of open source.  The Battle of the Printer.  The Rout of the HURD.  The Open Source Schism.  The conversion of the great, though flagging, [Empire of Armonk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM).  And we can place ourselves, however tentatively, in bit parts of this grand production.  Like extras in [_Ben Hur_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur_(1959_film)), we can try to point ourselves out in the action, but won't see our names in the credits.

What is the _War and Peace_ of open source?  What were the lived experiences and greater forces, of which Stallman, Torvalds, Wall, and Raymond merely symbolized?  How would we tell the story of open source without those convenient names?  Moreover, what did they represent that resonated so well in the experience of countless others?  What were the currents on which they rose, fell, and sailed on, like so many less than famous names?  Where are the [revisionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism) for open source?  Is there a [people's history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_history) to be told?

There are some popular "alternative" stories of free and open source.  But largely in the competitive vein of establishing open source as a mere tributary to a broader, more momentous movement, with its own pantheon of Greats.

This fairly describes many tellings of open source as symptom of the Internet phenomenon, starting from the BSD networking stack and DNS and flowing through Apache and Mozilla and wherever we stand today.  And there are many compelling story beats situating the story of open source as a subplot of Internet adoption, of an "openness" even more humanist, more fundamental.  Of course, telling people who are very good at Internet---programmers---that the Internet is very Powerful and Important tends to go down easy.  But I am here to suggest a different reading, less peculiar, more mundane:

Open source is a story of money, hype, and a whole lot of chance.

The luck of open source lay in straddling two great, independent phenomenon: the incredible froth and ballyhoo of the [Dot Common Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble), and the sudden, involuntary thrift of financial survival following the crash.  In short, through the mid to late 1990s, open source achieved mindshare and recognition as accomplice to a crop of vaguely Internet-related firms in desperate need of compelling differentiation.  When those companies went public, a few adherents, and even a few popular storytellers, gained the leverage of nominal wealth and follow-on fever.  When reality reasserted itself, the substance, rather than the style of open source---its low-as-in-zero price tag and insatiable thirst for user and developer time---
