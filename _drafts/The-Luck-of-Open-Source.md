[_War and Peace_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace) weighs so much in part because it's two works in one: first an epic novel of tsarist Russia, then a forceful essay on what the novel _means_.  What _War and Peace_ dramatizes, according to Tolstoy, is the folly of understanding history as a drawing room play of a few ["Great Men"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory), flanked by casts of thousands or millions in background-filling roles, as hapless minions.  Personalizing history at a level we can understand, like a sports match or a family feud, makes better stories.  But the arc of human experience traces the competing collective desires, choices, and struggles of great masses of individuals, families, and sundry associations---Great or not---both subject to and part of great currents of change.  Currents beyond the comprehension of any one of them, or any Russian novelist.

The dominant story of open source is a Great Men story.  The Battle of the Printer.  The Rout of the HURD.  The Open Source Schism.  The Mozillian Gambit.  The conversion of the flagging, initially hostile [Empire of Armonk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM).  And we can place ourselves, however tentatively, in bit parts of this big production.  Like extras in [_Ben Hur_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur_(1959_film)), we can try to point ourselves out in the action, if not in the credits.

What is the _War and Peace_ of open source?  What were the lived experiences and greater forces that Stallman, Torvalds, and Raymond responded to, and came to symbolize?  How would we tell the story of open source without those convenient names?  With the dust of propaganda and journalism settled, when can we expect the [revisionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism)?  How would a [people's history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_history) of open source read?

There are some popular "alternative" tellings of free software and open source.  But largely in the competitive vein of establishing open source as mere tributary to a broader, more momentous story, with its own pantheon of still greater Greats.  Such is open source as side quest of the grander Internet phenomenon, from the BSD network stack and DNS, tracing through Apache and Mozilla to wherever we stand today.  Many compelling story beats intersect, convenient for relegating open source to a subplot.  Open source was open, but a mere specialization of a more general, more ambitious, more humanist notion of openness, firmly grounded in the hardware coup.

Telling people who are very good at the Internet---software people---that the Internet is Very Important and Very Powerful also tends to go over well, even if the story's no longer mostly about them.  But I am here to suggest another story of open source, less peculiar, more mundane, non-ingratiating:

Open source is a story of money, hype, and fortunate timing.  The luck of open source lay in straddling an epochal market moment, created as much by speculators as engineers: the incredible froth and ballyhoo of the [Dot Common Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) and the sudden, involuntary shift to thrift once it burst.

Through the middle to late 1990s, open source achieved mindshare and recognition as codeveloped marketing accomplice to a crop of tech firms, largely pickaxe-in-gold-rush types, in need of a revolutionary spin.  Some movements folks got stock, and some of them built or buoyed their own businesses, by near association.  When the new firms successfully went public, which wasn't that hard at the time, a few movement adherents, propagandists, and soothsayers gained the leverage of paper wealth and follow-on fever.

Open source as "revolution".  Cobalt, Red Hat, and VA all went public in 1999, and did well.  So far, so very good.

Then reality reasserted itself.  The bubble burst.  Paper gains evaporated, paper friends disappeared.

In those ashes, the substance rather than the style of open source---its low-as-can-go price tag and insatiable thirst for hacker attention---asserted itself.  The free in "free software" _did_ mean "free as as in beer" after all.  At least, as they said, if your time was worth nothing.  And as luck would have it, a lot of competent geeks, plus a lot of precocious children, had time to spare.  A lot more people got the price signal than essays on "philosophy".  The phrase "open source" became technical jargon for "free", with a valence of "some assembly required".  As more time piled in, the software actually got pretty decent.  Which left the story at "free", most of the time.

Looking back, I'm struck by how few of the dot-com companies relied on open source software.  Yes, they bought a lot of servers and massively inflated colo space.  But the VC funny money also bought a lot of licenses.  Microsoft was the world's most valuable company.  CISCO was connecting it all together.  Oracle was selling hand over fist.  The chipmakers made the "Power Five" almost by definition.  Even smaller, specialized shops, like Macromedia, were killing it, even if their customers weren't.  In short, the not-open incumbents the open "rebels" rebelled against were...incumbent. The Internet narrative of open source, which boasts the virtue of looking back this far, doesn't leave much of a gap for this transitional period.  But so it was.
