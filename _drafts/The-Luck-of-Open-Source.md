Part of the reason _War and Peace_ is so long is that it's really two works in one: first a long, epic novel of tsarist Russia under Napoleonic invasion, then a forceful essay on what that novel _means_.  What the novel dramatizes, according to Tolstoy, is the folly of understanding human history as a drawing room play of a few idiosyncratic "Great Mean", flanked by casts of thousands or millions of ordinary people in background-filling roles.  That's just a memorable way to make and tell catchy stories, by personalizing them at a social scale we can understand.  Yet the true arc of human experience traces the many aggregated desires, choices, and struggles of great masses of people, families, and sundry associations---"Great" or not---both subject to and part of great changes beyond the power or comprehension of any one of them, or any author.

So many of us know and share the Great Men drama of open source.  The Battle of the Printer.  The Rout of the HURD.  The Open Source Schism.  And we can place ourselves, however tentatively, in bit parts of this grand production.  Like extras in [_Ben Hur_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur_(1959_film)), we can try and point ourselves out in the action, but won't see our names in the credits.

What is the _War and Peace_ of open source?  What were the lived experiences and greater forces, of which the Stallmans, Torvalds, Walls, and Raymonds merely symbolized?  How would we tell the story of open source without those convenient personalities?  What did they symbolize, that resonated so well in the experience of countless others, less remarked?  What were the currents on which they rose, fell, and sailed on, like so many less than famous names?
