[_War and Peace_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace) weighs so much party because it's two works in one: first an epic novel of tsarist Russia, then a forceful essay on what the novel _means_.  What _War and Peace_ means, according to Tolstoy, is the folly of understanding history as a drawing room play of a few ["Great Men"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory), flanked by casts of thousands or millions in background-filling roles for minions.  Personalizing history at a level we can understand intuitively makes more memorable stories.  The true arc of human experience traces the many aggregated desires, choices, and struggles of great masses of individuals, families, and sundry associations---Great or not---both subject to and part of great changes beyond the power or comprehension of any one of them, or any Russian novelist.

The dominant story of open source is a Great Men story.  The Battle of the Printer.  The Rout of the HURD.  The Open Source Schism.  The conversion of the great flagging [Empire of Armonk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM).  And we can place ourselves, however tentatively, in bit parts of this grand production.  Like extras in [_Ben Hur_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Hur_(1959_film)), we can try to point ourselves out in the action, if not in the credits.

What is the _War and Peace_ of open source?  What were the lived experiences and greater forces that Stallman, Torvalds, Wall, and Raymond responded to and came to symbolize?  How would we tell the story of open source without those convenient names?  Is there an open source [revisionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_revisionism)?  Could there be a [people's history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_history)?

There are some popular "alternative" stories of free and open source.  But largely in the competitive vein of establishing open source as a mere tributary to a broader, more momentous story, with its own pantheon of Greats.  Such is the story of open source as mere symptom of the grander Internet phenomenon, starting from the BSD network stack and DNS, tracing through Apache and Mozilla to wherever we stand today.  Many compelling story beats intersect, relegating open source to a subplot, subsidiary to a saga of "openness" more general, more ambitious, more humanist, more grounded in fundamental innovation.

Telling people who are very good at the Internet---software people---that the Internet is Very Important and Very Powerful tends to find welcome ears.  But I am here to suggest another story of open source, less peculiar, more mundane, hardly flattering:

Open source is a story of money, hype, and fortunate timing.  The luck of open source lay in straddling an epochal market moment: the incredible froth and ballyhoo of the [Dot Common Bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble), then the sudden, involuntary thrift following its crash.

Through the middle to late 1990s, open source achieved mindshare and recognition as accomplice to a crop of tech firms, largely pickaxe-in-gold-rush types, in desperate need of a revolutionary line.  When those firms successfully went public, which wasn't that hard at the time, a few movement adherents, propagandists, and soothsayers gained the leverage of nominal wealth and follow-on fever.  Open source as "revolution".  So far, so good.  Cobalt, Red Hat, and VA all went public in 1999.

Then reality reasserted itself in the public markets.  Paper gains evaporated, and paper friends disappeared.  In the ashes, the substance, rather than the style of open source---its low-as-in-zero price tag and insatiable thirst for spare developer attention---reasserted itself.  The free in "free software" _did_ mean "free as as in beer" after all, if, as they said, your time installing, configuring, patching, and operating the mess was worth nothing.  A lot more people got that price signal than memos on software license philosophy.  All the sudden price was very, very important.  And a lot of competent geeks had time.
