If you have time and money to spend kitting yourself out for catastrophe---nuclear war, societal collapse, meteor strike---consider prepping for the true present threat to the American way of life.  Prepare to draw the short straw.  Prepare to become homeless.

Lots of the goods carry over.  Most of your vaguely camping-related gear will still be relevant. And you can have just as much fun shopping online, and on a lot of the same websites, while the going is good.  But rather than waiting on Hollywood or the self-published press to turn out the next disaster flick, you can just leave the house, pandemic permitting, and have a look around.  Instead of debating the what-ifs on forums, or finding YouTube infomercials to guide you, you can go out and ask the pros "in the field" right now.

Utilities stop working or cease to exist.  You'll be generating power, stealing it, or doing without.  Water will become heavy, expensive, and inconvenient, not free, and never entirely trustworthy.  You'll learn to show fire due respect, and still get burned from time to time.  You'll learn that when you have a phone and lose it, half the people you stopped answering, because you couldn't, assumed you fell off the face of the earth.

So will the government, since you now lack a fixed address.  Unless they decide to give you one, by putting you away somewhere.  Which they very well may do, eventually, since you'll quickly find there are a mess of laws you don't have much choice in breaking.  Some of those, especially local regulations, will target your kind specifically.  Some will take pains to avoid looking like they do, but the truth will remain transparent to literally all involved.  Cruel and unusual punishments remain strictly prohibited, except, apparently, if the crime is poverty, in which case the whole of society is in on the job, many without knowing it.

Then again, you'll likely have greater trouble, overall, with the mass of rules put to the books without any thought to your situation whatever.  By foundational bureaucratic principle, living in a way the system can't comprehend ranks its own kind of petty crime.  Nobody likes to think about this kind of thing, or the risk they may be next.  No system of authority likes to be reminded it hasn't got it all figured out.

In any event, life on the lam combines with the initial shock of eviction toward slowing popping open your mental gaskets, with or without the seductive aid of mind-altering substances.  His majesty ethanol, available at your local corner store at prices payable in loose change, beckons first.  But the gamut runs clear through cannabis, superior in every way besides felony status, to whatever the guy on the corner got sent out to sell today.  You won't need them to lose it.  Many do without.

Meanwhile, many social services, from medical help to addition treatment to police protection to elder care, will degrade to farce, become impractical, or simply cease to exist.  Some may even seem to turn on you.  Public and private charities, which seemed to be "on it" for any number of pressing social needs before your time on the street, will show through as inadequate, misconceived, self-righteous, and occasionally outright shams.  A few folks and organizations, of various kinds, will help in truly meaningful ways.  A few those will even be kind about it, and truly care, to whatever small extent they can manage to sustain.  That help may be enough to help keep you alive, but not to preserve your way of life.  By "way of life" I do not mean "lifestyle".  I mean something altogether more basic, which we can really only appreciate from a distance.  Usually from a long way down, looking a long way up to where we used to be.  Usually when things have already gone wrong.

In short, the America you know will surround you, but you won't be living there anymore.  You'll be living in the America that _is_, and has been, for a very uncomfortable number of your countrymen, for as long as anyone can remember.  America is not a "first world country" or "highly advanced economy".  It merely contains those things, among others.

Many of the projects of homeless survival benefit from good equipment.  Equipment you might prefer to acquire now, before you get sick, injured, sued, convicted, or similar, go broke, and end up on the street, in a car, or in shelters.  But in the end, nothing Amazon delivers will solve your new problems, or really even meaningfully address them.  Even if every one of your problems had a mail-order solution, homeless is a catchword for a packet of problems, all too many and all at once, awarded on those who fall off the blessed track.  Solving that many problems one-off is inherently cost-prohibitive.  It's easy enough to find some cheery, self-believing, and believable opinion on which pair of socks you'll want when you can only have one.  But homelessness isn't a shopping list, a box-ticking exercise from which one graduates by collecting them all.  There is just one box: housing.  If you have housing, nearly everything gets easier.  If you don't, nearly everything is hard.

Ideally, we'd spend a lot more time, money, and attention preventing these outcomes.  How to do that is hard to say with certainty, contentious in all particulars, and in the best case involves rather remote forms of gratification, if any at all.  It's the opposite of entertainment, which includes consumerism.  But I think it's clear that those of us who _can_ hack the root, instead of the branches, really ought to be trying to do that.  If you can't see the roots yet, start digging.

In the meantime, there are people for whom shelter, warmth, water, and the other basics of life, and the tools to get them, represent immediate needs, not hypothetical security blankets.  I for one prefer to put those things where they belong, which is not in my closet, and double down on holding my tongue, listening to those on the front lines, and doing the things they need done that speak to what I'm good at.
