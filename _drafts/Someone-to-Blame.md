Political history teaches that to become famous, rich, and powerful, give people a clear, simple theory that makes stubborn problems all around them seem clear, simple, and solvable.  Alas, history also teaches that stubborn problems are almost never simple, and simple theories don't solve them.  So you will also need someone to blame when your fails, especially if you happen to hold power at the time.  Otherwise, the failure falls on you.

How famous, rich, and powerful you can become, and how long you can stay that way, depend partly on luck, partly on the theory and the scapegoat you ride in on.

The best theories comfort people with memorable, reassuring stories and slogans that give people comforting illusions of predictability, mastery, and control they can think about instead of the anxiety, uncertainty, and powerlessness that life's complexities impose.  The best theories seduce and describe, with a strong hint of what is to be done.  On the other hand, bad theories sound so general, technical, or hand-wavy as to come off academic, esoteric, or nuts.  The worst simply tell how it is and why, leaving no room for miraculous improvement.

Free market maximalism is a good theory.  So is class struggle.  Astrology not so much.  Game theory not so much.  Peer-reviewed science and hard-nosed, trench-level political acumen?  Practically effective.  Politically, mostly useless.

The most helpful theories, the ones that really help solve tough problems in practice, don't garner votes, praise, or adoration.  Nuance, also known as realism, doesn't clear the path to fame, riches, or influence.  Nuance works.  But until it works, it's unappealing.  It's easy to sell the results of a nuanced approach after the fact.  Before the fact, nobody really wants to do all that work.

The best scapegoats are among us, but not of us.  They're easy to mark as other, foreign, or strange, but not so remote or absurd as to come off as bogeymen or delusions.

Minority groups, like Jews, remain good scapegoats.  Lizard People, not so much.  Specific individuals, families, or firms, like the Rothschilds, Bill Gates, or Microsoft, can work for a while.  But then the they die, fold, or veer off script, and cognitive distance kicks in.  Thus Illuminati conspiracy worked great when Bavarian men of letters represented a credit threat.  When that changed, political entrepreneurs segued from Illuminati to Freemasonry.  When Freemasonry started seeming hokey, they generalized to the New World Order.  The New World Order only sells with a long running start.  It's too close to lizard people.

It is difficult to say anything both simple and true about politics in America.  There are major parties, Democratic and Republican.  There are major ideologies, "liberal", "conservative", "Marxist", "libertarian".  There are imperfect correlations between ideologies and parties, changing all the time.  Political winners, and the aftershocks of their successes, cut lines through it all.  They find what sells, and bank on it, for as long as they can.

Personal responsibility is a good theory.  Collectivism and cooperation, too.  Laissez faire is a good theory.  Fair and level competition, too.  Wall Street is a great scapegoat.  Silicon Valley, too.  Moneyed elites as a whole, for that matter.  Yet immigrants, also, remain a perennial blame favorite.

Our two-party system seems odd and arbitrary, in the abstract.  But it's not hard to see how, as institutions, parties and their partisans might prefer things that way.  Each has its theories of the moment.  When all else fails, each can simply scapegoat the other: Democrats blame Republicans, Republicans blame Democrats.  As long as there's no real prospect of final victory, of one party totally dominating over the other, the conflict is stable.  Our party's simple theory of everything would work, each seems to say, if only we got rid of that other party, and could therefore act free of "obstructionism" or "resistance".  Conveniently of course, this won't happen.  Or at least it hasn't yet.

Ideally, it would never happen.  Whether by compromise, realism, or occasional flashes of enlightenment, government would be forced to mix and match dominant ideologies and policy approaches, plus a healthy helping of humble pragmatist.  The trouble, of course, is extremism.  The more simple theories fail, the more believers turn to scapegoats.  Deregulation would work, if not for the Democrats.  The social safety net would pay dividends, if not for the Republicans.  When we get to do it, it fails.  Not because it's too simple.  Because it was dirtied, compromised, sabotaged by the other side.

Having devolved from faith in a theory to anger at an enemy, everything veers animalistic, tribal, aggressive.  Total, dominating victory becomes the goal, the escape, the deliverance.  The drive toward total power, to finally let theory reign, becomes absolute, critical, essential.  The presidency.  The supreme court.  Both houses.  Direct action.  Every extreme fantasizes not of winning over converts, but of seizing absolute authority to act and compel belief, by trick, accident, or even armed revolution.  Results will speak for themselves, all will be forgiven, and anyone else will be banished or silenced or crushed.  Or so they hope.

History teaches the opposite.  Results will be disastrous.  True believers will bask in triumph, briefly, until their actions meet reality, and backfire.  Consequences kick in.  Reality, in all its complexity, reasserts itself, and it comes without mercy.
