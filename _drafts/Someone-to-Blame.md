Political history teaches us that to become famous, rich, and powerful, you have to give people a clear, simple theory that makes stubborn problems all around them clear and simple.  Alas, history also teaches that stubborn problems are almost never simple, and that simple theories don't solve them.  Simple political theories are bad political theories.  So you will also need someone to blame when your clear and simple theory fails to deliver.  Especially if you happen to hold power at the time.  Otherwise, the failure falls on you.

How famous, rich, and powerful you can become, and how long you can stay that way, depend partly on luck, partly on the theory and the scapegoat you ride in on.

The best theories comfort people with memorable, reassuring stories and slogans that edge out anxiety about uncertainty, complexity, and powerlessness with comforting illusions of predictability, mastery, and control in their lives.  The best theories seduce and describe, with at least a strong hint of what-is-to-be-done.  On the other hand, bad theories sound so general, technical, or hand-wavy as to come off academic, esoteric, or nuts.  The worst simply tell how it is, without any promise to fix it.

Free market maximalism is a lasting and potent theory.  So is class struggle.  Astrology not so much.  Game theory not so much.  Peer-reviewed science and hard-nosed, trench-level political acumen?  Practically effective.  Politically useless.

The most helpful theories, the ones that help solve tough problems in practice, don't garner votes, praise, or adoration.  Nuance, also known as realism, doesn't clear the path to fame, riches, or influence.  Nuance works.  But until it works, it's unappealing.  It's easy to sell the results of a nuanced approach.  It's difficult or impossible to sell the approach itself.

When it comes to scapegoats, the best are with us, but not of us.  They're easy to mark as other, foreign, or strange, but not so remote or absurd as to come off as bogeymen or delusions.

Jews, alas, remain a great scapegoat.  Lizard People, not so much.  Specific individuals, families, or firms, like the Rothschilds, Bill Gates, or Microsoft, can work for a while.  But then the they die, fold, or veer off script, and cognitive distance kicks in.  Thus Illuminati conspiracy was redefined, several times, then transposed to Freemasonry, then generalized to the New World Order.  The New World Order only sells with a long running start.  Bavarian men of letters were far more concrete, but don't pose quite the credible threat they once did.

What good is all this?  It is difficult to say anything simple and true about politics in America.  There are major parties, Democratic and Republican.  There are major ideologies, "liberal", "conservative", "Marxist", "libertarian".  There are imperfect correlations between them and meaningful political parties, waxing and waning all the time.  Political entrepreneurs, and the aftershocks of their successes, cut lines through it all.  They find what sells, and bank on it.

Personal responsibility is a good theory.  Collectivism and cooperation, too.  Laissez faire is a good theory.  Fair and level competition, too.  Wall Street is a great scapegoat.  Silicon Valley, too.  Moneyed elites as a whole, for that matter.  Yet immigrants, also, remain a perennial blame favorite.

Our two-party system seems odd and arbitrary, in the abstract.  But it's not hard to see how, as institutions, they might prefer it that way.  Each has its theories.  Each scapegoats the other.  As long as there's no real prospect of final victory, of total, dominating political power, the conflict is stable.  Our straightforward theory would work, each says in its way, if only it got an unencumbered chance, free of "obstructionism" or "resistance".  Conveniently, it won't.  Or at least it hasn't yet.

The trouble, of course, is the pressure toward extremes.  The more simple theories fail, the more believers turn to scapegoats.  Deregulation would work, if not for the Democrats.  Social investment would work, if not for the Republicans.  When we get to do it, it fails.  Not because it's too simple.  Because it was dirtied, compromised, impure.

Having devolved from faith in a theory to anger at an enemy, everything veers animalistic, tribal, aggressive.  Total, dominating victory becomes the goal, the escape, the deliverance.  The drive toward total power, to finally let theory reign, becomes absolute, critical, essential.  The presidency.  The supreme court.  Both houses.  Direct action.  Every extreme fantasizes not of winning on theory, but of seizing absolute authority to act, by trick, accident, or even armed revolution, at which point results will speak for themselves, all will be forgiven, and anyone else will be banished or silenced or crushed.

History teaches the opposite.  Results will be disastrous.  True believers will bask in triumph, briefly, until their actions meet reality long enough to backfire.  Then consequence kicks in.  Nuance reasserts itself.  Reality reasserts itself, and it comes without mercy.
