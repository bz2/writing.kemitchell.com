Politics teaches that to become famous, rich, and powerful, you need to give people a clear, simple theory that makes stubborn problems all around them simple, too.  Alas, history teaches that stubborn problems are almost never simple, and that simple theories can't make them simple or solve them.  Simple theories fail.  So you will also need someone to blame for that failure.  Especially if happen to find yourself in power at the time.  Otherwise, the failure will fall on you.

How famous, rich, and powerful you can become, and how long you can stay that way, depend partly on luck, partly on the theory and the scapegoat you ride in on.

The best theories comfort people with memorable, reassuring words and stories that edge out anxiety about uncertainty, complexity, and powerlessness with comforting illusions of predictability, mastery, and control.  They're seductive and descriptive, with at least a strong hint of what-is-to-be-done.  On the other hand, bad theories sound so general, technical, or hand-wavy as to come off academic, esoteric, or nuts.

Free market maximalism is a lasting and potent theory.  So is class struggle.  Astrology not so much.  Game theory not so much.  Peer-reviewed science and hard-nosed, trench-level political acumen?  Almost never.

The most useful theories, the ones that help solve tough problems in practice, don't garner votes, praise, or adoration.  Nuance, also known as realism, doesn't clear the path to fame, riches, or influence.  Nuance works.  But before it works, it's damn hard to sell.

The best scapegoats are with us, but not of us.  They're easy to mark as other or foreign, but not so remote or absurd as to come off fanciful or delusional.

Jews, alas, remain a great scapegoat.  Lizard People, not so much.  Specific individuals, families, or firms, like the Rothschilds, Bill Gates, or Microsoft, can work for a while.  But then the they die, fold, or take a turn, and unhelpful cognitive distance kicks in.  Thus Illuminati conspiracy was redefined, several times, then transposed to Freemason conspiracy, then generalized to the New World Order.  The New World Order only flies with a long running start.  But Bavarian men of letters don't rouse the flock like they once did.

It is difficult to say anything simple and true about politics in America.  There are major parties, Democratic and Republican.  There are major ideologies, "progressive" and "conservative".  There are imperfect correlations between them.  Political entrepreneurs, and the aftershocks of their successes, strike lines through it all.

Personal responsibility is a good theory.  Collectivism and cooperation, too.  Laissez faire is a good theory.  Fair and level competition, too.  Wall Street is a great scapegoat.  Silicon Valley, too.  Moneyed elites as a whole, for that matter.  Yet immigrants, too, remain a perennial stepping stone.

Our two-party system seems odd and arbitrary, from the top down.  But it's not hard to see how two at odds might prefer it that way, from the bottom up.  Each has its theories.  Each scapegoats the other.  As long as there's no real prospect of final victory, of total, dominating political power, the conflict is stable.  Our straightforward theory would work, if only it got an unencumbered chance, free of "obstructionism" or "resistance".  Conveniently, it won't.

The trouble, of course, is the pressure toward extremes.  The more simple theories fail, the more believers turn to scapegoats.  Deregulation would work, if not for the Democrats.  Social investment would work, if not for the Republicans.

Having devolved from faith in a theory to anger at an enemy, further down the proverbial brain stem, everything becomes that much more animalistic, tribal, aggressive.  Total, dominating victory becomes the goal, the grace, the deliverance.  The drive toward total power, to finally give theory free reign, becomes absolute, critical, essential.  Each extreme fantasizes not of winning on theory, but of seizing absolute authority to act, by trick, accident, or even armed revolution, at which point results will speak for themselves.  Ambitious promises as much.  History teaches the opposite.  Results will be disastrous.  True believers will bask in triumph, for a while.  Then the consequences kick in.  Nuance reasserts itself.  When reality checks, it comes without mercy.
